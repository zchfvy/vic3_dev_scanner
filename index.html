<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #0 (HE VISION</font></p>
<p>Hello everyone!  </p>
<p>Yes, you’re seeing this right. No, this isn’t a belated April Fools joke. After all these years, and all these memes, Victoria 3 really is confirmed at last. I’m Martin “Wiz” Anward, the Game Director of Victoria 3, and it’s my absolute pleasure to finally be able to reveal what I have been working on since 2018 (around the time I stepped down as Game Director of Stellaris).  </p>
<p>So what, then, is Victoria 3? I can start by telling you that it’s most definitely a proper Victoria game - namely a game with a core focus on Economy, Politics and Internal Country Management and with the iconic Victoria Pop system not just included as a core mechanic but made even deeper than in either of its predecessors.  </p>
<p>Though Victoria 3 is its own game and not an iteration on Victoria 2, our ambition is to create a worthy successor that stays true to the core values of the Victoria series while using what have learned over the last decade in terms of making games more accessible - so that we can use that accessibility to build an even deeper game for old and new players alike!  </p>
<p>Our vision for Victoria 3 is to create what we call a ‘Society Sim’ - a game that is first and foremost about the internal workings of the 19th-century country that you are playing and how its society is shaped over the course of the game. Politics, Economy and Diplomacy are the three most important parts of the game - Wars are of course a part of the game (just as they were a part of the Victorian age), but Victoria 3 is <em>not</em> a wargame or a game about map painting.  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>Oh, and before you start speculating crazily about what is and is not in the game: No, there is no mana!  </p>
<p>Now, there is going to be a lot of dev diaries going forward to dig into the mechanics of the game, but to wrap up this dev diary I want to briefly touch on the four game design pillars that we have been following when designing and building Victoria 3:  </p>
<ul>
<li>National Gardening: Building, shaping, tweaking and evolving your nation is the first and foremost focus of the game. Events outside your country’s borders can naturally affect your country in significant ways, but the game should never rely on war to provide the main source of enjoyment.</li>
<li>Diplomatic Eminence: War is a continuation of diplomacy, and everything that is achievable by war should also be achievable through diplomacy (even if that diplomacy sometimes comes at the point of a gun).</li>
<li>Everything is Political: Politics is at the heart of Victoria 3, and all major features should in some way tie back into the Pops and Interest Groups that form the core of the game’s politics.</li>
<li>Era of Change: The Victorian era was a time of immense change politically, technologically, culturally, militarily and socially, and these changes should be reflected in the experience of playing a campaign of Victoria 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all for this week, but we’ll see you next week, when we’ll be talking about the return of the Victoria Pop System and the introduction of Dependents.  </p>
<p>We'll also have a lot more exciting news to share as we go, so make sure to follow us on <a href="http://facebook.com/VictoriaGamePDX">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PDXVictoria">Twitter</a>, Discord, the Paradox Forums and the <a href="https://pdxint.at/3v3dEWm">official Victoria 3 website</a> to stay up to date.</p>

<h1><a href="self.source">Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #1 - Pops</a></h1>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%231%20-%20Pops/Dev%20Diary%201.png"><img alt="Dev Diary 1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%231%20-%20Pops/Dev%20Diary%201.png" title="Dev Diary 1.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #1 Pops</font></p>
<p>Hello everyone! I’m Mikael, Victoria 3’s lead game designer - and <em>oh boy</em> does it feel good to finally be able to say that out loud! Today I have the pleasure to reveal some details about that one feature everyone thinks about when they hear “Victoria” - the Pops.  </p>
<p>Pops were introduced in the very first Victoria game to represent your country’s population. Pop mechanics have since snuck into other Paradox titles like Stellaris and Imperator. But this in-depth population simulation is what Victoria is about, and we’re going to bring you a system with more depth than ever before!  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3, Pops are the country’s engine - they work the industries, they pay the taxes, they operate the government institutions, and they fight the wars. They’re born, they die, they change occupation, they migrate. And they organize, get angry, and start revolutions.  </p>
<p>*Every Pop is visualized so you can see which demographic sports the best moustache. Note that Pop portraits are very much a work in progress!  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%231%20-%20Pops/ClergyCrop.png"><img alt="ClergyCrop.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%231%20-%20Pops/ClergyCrop.png" title="ClergyCrop.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: French Catholic men EARLY FOOTAGE UNDER DEVELOPMENT Secure (20) Clergvi</font>*  </p>
<p>You, the player, might be in charge of the country, but you’re not in charge of the Pops and can’t manipulate them directly. Yet everything you do to the country affects them, and they in turn will react in what they perceive to be their own best interests. A large part of your game will consist of trying to sate your population’s appetites for material goods or political reform. But most actions you will take aren’t to the benefit of every Pop in your nation, and by making life better for one part of the population you may inadvertently upset another demographic.  </p>
<p>The most important aspect of Pops are their <em>Professions</em>, which reflects the types of jobs it carries out in the building where they work. A Pop’s profession determines its social class and can affect its wages, political strength, what other professions it might qualify for, and particularly which political Interest Groups it’s prone to supporting (which you will hear lots more about in future Dev Diaries.) Some of the Pop professions you will encounter in Victoria 3 are Aristocrats, Capitalists, Bureaucrats, Officers, Shopkeepers, Machinists, Laborers, and Peasants. Investing in industries that provide job opportunities for the kinds of professions you want to encourage in your country is key to the “society building” gameplay of Victoria 3.  </p>
<p><em>Every variation of Profession, Culture, Religion, and Workplace in the world gets its own unique Pop. At any given time this results in many tens of thousands of Pops in the world working, migrating, procreating, and agitating.</em>  </p>

<p>The people that make up a Pop are distinguished into <em>Workforce</em> and <em>Dependents</em>. Members of the Workforce keep the buildings in the game operational and collect a wage from them in return. Those who cannot or aren’t permitted to be officially employed are considered Dependents. They collect only a small income from odd jobs and government programs.  </p>
<p>Laws affect who is included in each category. At game start most countries do not accept women working and collecting a wage outside the home but by reforming laws governing the rights of women more Dependent Pops will enter the Workforce over time. By abolishing child labor, the amount of income Dependents bring home will decrease but will make it easier to educate your populace, increasing their overall Literacy. After a bloody war many Dependents of soldiers may be left without sufficient income, and you may decide to institute pensions to help your population recover.  </p>
<p>In short: nothing in your country runs without Pops, and everything about your country affects those Pops, who in turn provide new opportunities and challenges during your tumultuous journey through the Victorian era and beyond.  </p>
<p>I have <em>oh so much more</em> to say, but that is all for this week! You will hear much more from me in future Dev Diaries. Next week Martin will return to explain something quite central to the game - Capacities!</p>

<p>Yes, to be clear the depicted Pop is just representing the Turkish Sunni Aristocrats who own the Subsistence Farms in the state of Diyarbakir. Across all of the Ottoman Empire there could be dozens or even hundreds of different Aristocrat Pops, of different cultures/religions, states, and workplaces.</p>

<p>Crossposting this from another thread on the topic so it isn't missed:  </p>
<p>Dependents earn an income, this income is less than the workforce earns but still incredibly important to poor pops if there isn't minimum wages/social programs. Also, more liberal countries start with at least some women in the workforce to represent female factory workers, etc. So we are definitely not aiming to simulate all women as housewives.</p>

<p>Totally accurate - or, at least, to my knowledge it is accurate for many European cultures, at least for specific professions! This is one of the reasons why we've differentiated between <em>Workforce</em> and <em>Dependents</em>, rather than <em>Men</em>, <em>Women</em>, <em>Children</em>, <em>Seniors</em> etc. There are too many idiosyncratic cultural variations - and cultures <em>changing</em> over the eras - to model gender norms correctly in every context.  </p>
<p>The gameplay effect we're after here is that in the early game, a large number of Pops (<em>whoever</em> they may be) aren't able to contribute to the country's industrialized workforce, can't vote, can't become soldiers, etcetera. Their meager income is considered to be earned outside the dominant industries and cannot be tracked and taxed by the state, and is affected by laws like Child Labor and Pension institutions. If the country reforms its views on women they gain (among other things) greater access to workforce that can work these formal, taxed, often urban professions. But there will always be a lot of Dependents in every Pop.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We'll talk more about our approach to giving the player access to <em>aggregate</em> information about Pops in their country in another DD. There are many, many ways of seeing information <em>about</em> your Pops in the game, in ways that are more actionable than scrolling through enormous lists of individual Pops. For this DD I wanted to zoom in on individuals, to focus on the properties of the fundamental "atom" of the simulation.  </p>
<p>As for Ideologies, these don't reside on the Pop level directly but are rather associated with Interest Groups, which act as the Pops' political representatives. Pops determine what Interest Group to support based on their properties, particularly their Profession but also how wealthy they are, how educated they are, etc. A single Pop can split their support between multiple Interest Groups, too. Attitudes are modelled a bit differently - Pops can have <em>Radicals</em> and <em>Loyalists</em>, Interest Groups have Approval ratings, Literacy affect Political Participation, and so on. We'll get into that more when we get to talking about the political system, but you'll have to be a bit patient there since we have to cover a few other topics first.</p>

<p>In general I'd like to say: We know you want to know more about how everything Pop-related works, but if I did that it would be the whole game, basically. We will be talking about migration, qualifications, literacy, radicals and loyalists, assimilation, consumption, wealth, fertility and mortality, and much much more in the weeks to come, but each of these is basically its own dev diary.

<p>We do actually! With respect to the USA, each current US state corresponds exactly to one named state region in the game (although in some cases state regions can split into multiple states owned by different countries.) Pops can move freely within workplaces in their state, while they need to undergo migration in order to move between states.  </p>
<p>With respect to <em>granularity</em> though, there's really no downside to having Pops be able to move freely within their state rather than having to migrate between a handful of provinces within the same state as in previous titles. We still represent the urban/rural divide by permitting many, many different types of industry in each state, including both manufacturing and resource industries (as opposed to one static "RGO" per province) and service/governmental/infrastructure/military workplaces. These different industries and workplaces are visually grouped on the map such that you can see the urbanization and growth of some parts of your state compared to others.</p>

<p>This has been one of the biggest concerns for me, is this system able to model things like San Francisco's population getting huge but its surroundings being essentially empty, though? It seems to me like this is incredibly inflexible and will be unable to truly model the rural -&gt; urban migration that happened at the time, while also seeming unlikely to be able to model the opposite if we take our country down that path.  </p>
<p>Another very important thing:  </p>
<p>The way the equivalent to RGOs appears to work implies we only have one per state though, right? I can't have both coal and iron in one state, for example?  </p>
<p>That'd make the statement that we have more and more varied workplaces available still hold true, but it would be a lot less RGO-equivalents across the world than Vicky 2 had. Nearly the same amount of RGO-equivalents as Vicky 2 had states, even. This would greatly limit how interesting the economy aspect can be especially for smaller countries who'd like to focus on resource gathering and exporting.  </p>
<p>It would also fail to represent areas that historically had both, rich iron and coal resources or rich farmlands and rich grazing lands and so on.</p>

<p>A single state can support numerous variations of different mines, agriculture, plantations, logging, fishing etc and you can definitely have a state where almost the entire population lives and works in the urban area.</p>

<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%232%20-%20Capacities/ThumbnailTemplate_1920x1080.png"><img alt="ThumbnailTemplate_1920x1080.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%232%20-%20Capacities/ThumbnailTemplate_1920x1080.png" title="ThumbnailTemplate_1920x1080.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #2 ~CAPACITIES</font></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to another Victoria 3 dev diary! Today we will be talking about three of the four of the main ‘currencies’ of the game - namely Capacities (the last being Money, which we’ll of course come back to later).  </p>
<p>We mentioned in the very first dev diary that there is no ‘mana’ in Victoria 3, and since this dev diary is about the game’s “currencies”, I want to be clear on what I mean by that. When we say there is “no mana” we mean that the resources in Victoria 3 arise and are spent in clearly defined ways that are parts of the simulation, not from an overly abstract concept or vague idea. There is, of course, some degree of abstraction involved (all games are abstractions after all), but we want all the game’s currencies to be strongly rooted in the mechanics and not feel arbitrary.  </p>
<p>But enough about that and onto Capacities. What exactly are they?  </p>
<p>Well, for starters, calling them currencies is actually not accurate. Capacities are not a pooled resource and are not accumulated or spent, but instead, have a constant <strong>generation</strong> and a constant <strong>usage</strong> (similar to for example Administrative Capacity in Stellaris), and you generally want to keep your usage from exceeding your generation. Each capacity represents one specific area of your nation’s ability to govern and is used solely for matters relating to that area.  </p>
<p>As mentioned, Capacities are not accumulated, so excess generation is not pooled, but instead there is an effect for each Capacity which is positive if generation exceeds usage and quite negative if usage exceeds generation - a country that incorporates territories left and right without expanding its bureaucratic corps may quickly find itself mired in debt as tax collection collapses under the strain!  </p>
<p><strong>Bureaucracy</strong> represents a nation’s ability to govern, invest in and collect taxes from its incorporated territory. It is produced by the Government Administration building, where many of a nation’s Bureaucrats will be employed. All of a nation’s Incorporated States use a base amount of Bureaucracy which increases with the size of their population, and further increased by each Institution (such as Education or Police - more on those later!) that a country has invested in. Overall, the purpose of Bureaucracy is to ensure that there is a cost to ruling over, taxing and providing for your population - administrating China should not be cheap!  </p>
<p><em>The Swedish Bureaucracy is currently a bit overworked and the country could certainly benefit from another Government Administration building or two.</em>  </p>
<p>*<a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%232%20-%20Capacities/bureaucracy.PNG"><img alt="bureaucracy.PNG" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%232%20-%20Capacities/bureaucracy.PNG" title="bureaucracy.PNG" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Authority</strong> represents the Head of State’s personal power and ability to enact change in the country through decree. It is generated from your Laws - generally, the more repressive and authoritarian the country, the more Authority it will generate - and is used by a variety of actions such as enacting decrees in specific states, interacting with Interest Groups and promoting or banning certain types of Goods. Overall, the purpose of Authority is to create an interesting trade-off between more and less authoritarian societies - by shifting the distribution of power away from the Pops into the hands of the ruler, your ability to rule by decree is increased, and vice versa.  </p>
<p><em>The Swedish King has more Authority at his disposal than he is currently using, slightly speeding up the rate at which laws can be passed.</em>  </p>

<p><strong>Influence</strong> represents a country’s ability to conduct diplomacy and its reach on the global stage. It is generated primarily from your Rank (Great Powers have more Influence than Major Powers and so on) and is used to support ongoing diplomatic actions and pacts, such as Improving Relations, Alliances, Trade Deals, Subjects and so on. Overall, the purpose of Influence is to force players to make interesting choices about which foreign countries they want to build strong diplomatic relationships with.  </p>
<p><em>Sweden has plenty of unused Influence and could certainly afford to support another diplomatic pact or two!</em>  </p>

<p>We're going to delve more into buildings next week, but you can think of building a Government Administration as essentially creating the offices, logistics etc for your bureaucrats - without it they can't do their jobs, but you still need qualified, literate pops to take those jobs and without them it's just an empty complex doing nothing. All buildings work like this in Victoria 3, including ports and railroads (which did not need pops to function in V2). You even need to employ pops to construct things for you in V3.</p>

<p>Some buildings are limited by things like resources or arable land (for example, iron mines are limited by how much iron is available in the region), but only where it makes sense. How large your cities can grow is really only limited by population.</p>

<p>Voting rights don't directly increase the wealth of pops, but they do give them the ability to push for social reforms that benefit them, which in turn may mean the player is able to get those reforms passed.</p>

<p>It's not clear just from this screenshot, but <strong>Freedom of Assembly</strong> is a law in the <strong>Free Speech</strong> category of Laws, which "culminates" in <strong>Protected Speech</strong>. As the most liberal Law in this category, it grants no Authority, while more repressive Laws (like Freedom of Assembly) do. In isolation from the rest of the game, of course that means it looks like granting your people rights increases your Authority but that is actually the opposite of what is happening.  </p>
<p>Also, this is <em>of course</em> not the <em>only</em> thing Free Speech Laws govern, there are other effects of the Laws as well which provide trade-offs to your country, but this is the only effect it has <em>on Authority</em>.  </p>
<p>The reason why <strong>Road Maintenance</strong> uses Authority is because it's a decree (one of many different types) issued in a state to its population, and doesn't cost the government anything other than the Authority to ensure its people are following its directives. This is a pretty early-game solution to maintaining a good market connections in a few states at a time, more effective means of leveraging your economy to ensure cohesion between your states tend to emerge later in the game, freeing your Authority up for other things like suppressing your political opponents (or, you know, granting your people more rights, if that's how you want to go about it.)</p>

<p>Absolute monarchs never actually had absolute power, an absolute monarch without a power base is not going to remain a monarch for much longer.

<p>The need for bureaucracy scales upwards with a higher incorporated population, especially if you want to run social programs. You're essentially paying for every pop you want to educate, provide healthcare for, etc. As the example given, it's extremely expensive just to govern China, providing it with solid infrastructure and social programs is meant to be a herculean undertaking.</p>

<p>Bureaucracy usage scales with the number of people you administrate. Providing education to a million people is ten times more expensive than providing it to a hundred thousand people. There is also a flat cost per incorporated state, to represent the difficulties in governing large territories (even if those territories are depopulated).</p>

Buildings are a core mechanic of Victoria 3, as it is where the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-1-pops.1476573/">Pops</a> work to produce resources such as Goods. Buildings represent a wide range of industries, businesses and government functions, from humble subsistence farms to complex motor industries and sprawling financial districts. In this dev diary, we’re going to broadly cover the main types of buildings and their function in Victoria 3.  </p>
<p>To talk about buildings though, I first have to mention states! States are a concept that should be generally familiar to anyone who’s played some of our other games such as Victoria II or Hearts of Iron IV - a geographic unit of varying size in which much of Victoria 3’s gameplay takes place. States are where Pops live and (more importantly for our subject matter) where Buildings are located and built.  </p>
<p><em>The State of Götaland in Sweden</em>  </p>

<p>We will return to states more in later dev diaries, but for now let’s keep talking about Buildings!  </p>
<p>Before we start on Buildings, something that’s important to note is that Buildings are just places where Pops can work and generally do not represent a single building - a single level of Government Administration, for example, represents the necessary buildings and infrastructure to support a certain number of Bureaucrats. Buildings always need qualified pops to work in them to yield any benefit, and an empty building is just that - empty and completely useless. This holds true even for buildings like Railroads and Ports that did not need Pops to work in them in Victoria 2.  </p>
<p>Most buildings are directly constructed, but some (like the Subsistence Buildings below) will appear automatically based on certain conditions. When Buildings are constructed, the construction uses Pop labor and goods, and the costs involved will be subject to market forces.  </p>
<p>But onto the different building types! First out, we have <strong>Subsistence Buildings</strong>. These are a special type of highly inefficient Buildings that cannot manually be built or destroyed, but rather will appear anywhere in the world where there is Arable Land that isn’t being used for another type of building. The vast majority of the world’s population starts the game ‘working’ in subsistence buildings as Peasants, and much of the game’s industrialization process is about finding more productive employment for your Peasants.  </p>
<p><em>Peasants eke out a meager living in these Subsistence Farms, contributing little to GDP and taxes per capita</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%233%20-%20Buildings/dd3_2.png"><img alt="dd3_2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%233%20-%20Buildings/dd3_2.png" title="dd3_2.png" /></a></p>

Average Vage: Building using,</font></p>
<p>Another special type of building is <strong>Urban Centers</strong>. Like Subsistence Buildings, these are automatically created rather than built, with the level of Urban Center in a State being tied to the amount of Urbanization generated by its other buildings. Urban Centers primarily employ Shopkeepers and provide a number of important local functions that we will get into at a later point.  </p>
<p>*The Urban Center is where you’ll find most of your middle-class Shopkeepers  </p>

One level of Urban Center is created for each 100 Urbanization in the State. Production Methods E+ Vage:</font>*​  </p>
<p>Next up we have <strong>Government Buildings</strong>. These are buildings that are fully funded by the state (ie, you!) and provide crucial civil services required for the smooth running of a Victorian nation. Examples include Government Administrations where Bureaucrats produce Bureaucracy for the administration of incorporated states and funding of Institutions, and Universities where Academics produce Innovation for technological progression.  </p>
<p><em>Bureaucrats work in Government Administrations to provide Bureaucracy - the lifeblood of the government</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%233%20-%20Buildings/dd3_4.png"><img alt="dd3_4.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%233%20-%20Buildings/dd3_4.png" title="dd3_4.png" /></a></p>

<p>The counterpart to Government Buildings is <strong>Private Industries</strong>. The vast majority of Buildings in Victoria 3 fall under this category, which includes a broad range of industries such as (non-subsistence!) farms, plantations, mines and factories. Unlike Government Buildings, Private Industries are not owned by the state but rather by Pops such as Capitalists and Aristocrats, who reap the profits they bring in and pay wages to the other Pops working there (usually at least - under certain economic systems the ownership of buildings may be radically different!).  </p>
<p>Many of these buildings are limited by locally available resources such as Arable Land for agriculture and simply how much iron is available in the state for Iron Mines. Urban Buildings such as Factories however, are only limited by how many people you can cram into the state, simulating the more densely populated nature of cities. In short, there is no system of building ‘slots’ or anything like that, as we want limitations on buildings to function in a sensible and realistic way.  </p>
<p><em>Several different types of Private Industries are shown below</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%233%20-%20Buildings/dd3_5.png"><img alt="dd3_5.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%233%20-%20Buildings/dd3_5.png" title="dd3_5.png" /></a></p>

<p>Finally there are <strong>Development Buildings</strong>. These are often (but not always!) government buildings that distinguish themselves by providing vital state-level functions. A couple examples are Barracks that recruit and train soldiers from the local population and Railways that provide the Infrastructure other buildings need to bring their goods to the Market.  </p>
<p><em>From left to right: Barracks, Port, Naval Bases and Railway</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Development 1/3</font></p>
<p>To finish up this dev diary I just want to mention that building up your country is meant to be more of a hands-on experience in Victoria 3, as this is absolutely core to the society-building aspect of the game and forms a major part of the game’s core loop. This naturally also means that we need to give the player the necessary tools to manage their buildings in a large empire, which may involve some form of autonomous building construction, though we haven’t yet nailed down exactly what form that would take (and whether it will involve decision making on the part of the investor class). Ultimately though, we want the player, not the AI to be the one primarily in charge of the development of their own country.  </p>
<p>Well, there you have it. There is of course a lot in here (such as Production Methods) that will receive further explanation in the many more dev diaries we have planned, so be sure to tune in next week as I talk about Goods. See you then!</p>

<h1><a href="self.source">Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #4 - Goods</a></h1>
<p>Happy Thursday and welcome back to yet another Victoria 3 dev diary, this time on the subject of Goods! Goods are a core economic feature of Victoria 3, just as they were in previous Victoria games, and come in a wide variety of types. Also, as in previous Victoria games, the manufacturing of Goods (by <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-1-pops.1476573/">Pops</a> in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-3-buildings.1478868/">Buildings</a>) is how the vast majority of the wealth in Victoria 3 is created.  </p>
<p>Fundamentally, a unit of Goods represent a quantity of a certain type of natural resource, manufactured good or intangible service and come attached with a price tag. This price varies both in base (a single unit of Tanks is pricier than a single unit of Fabric) and in actual market value, as the prices of Goods change depending on supply and demand.  </p>
<p><em>A selection of goods that are bought and sold in the British Market.</em>  </p>

<p>There are four broad categories of Goods: Staple Goods, Luxury Goods, Industrial Goods and Military Goods. Of these, Staple/Luxury Goods are mainly consumed by Pops, and Industrial/Military Goods are mainly consumed by buildings, but there are no hard rules here - you will find Buildings using Luxury Goods and Pops purchasing Industrial Goods when and where it makes sense for them to do so.  </p>
<p><strong>Staple Goods</strong> are everyday goods that Pops need to live, such as food to eat, wood to heat their homes, and clothes to wear. Staple Goods tend to be purchased in vast quantities by poor and middle class pops, with richer pops generally eschewing them for luxury variants.  </p>
<p><em>Grain - possibly the most Staple of all Staple Goods!</em>  </p>

<p><strong>Luxury Goods</strong> are the things that Pops do not necessarily need but definitely want, such as fine foods, luxury drinks like Tea and Coffee, or fine clothes made from chinese silk. Luxuries tend to be more profitable to produce than Staple Goods, but depend on having a customer base with money - a poor factory worker isn’t going to be buying a whole lot of mahogany cabinets.  </p>

<p><strong>Industrial Goods</strong> are goods such as Iron, Coal, Rubber and Lead whose main purpose is often to be converted into other, more profitable goods. Securing a steady supply of vital Industrial Goods is crucial to Industrialization and growing the GDP of your country.  </p>

The more technologically advanced the army or navy, the more complex (and expensive!) Military Goods they will need.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>In Victoria 3, Pops require buildings to be productive and vice versa. So for a region to be a major producer of a certain trade good, it requires a large workforce to work the buildings producing it. If a region is just highly populated but not well developed, the Pops sustain themselves off the land in Subsistence buildings, which occupy all otherwise undeveloped land by default.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's cultural. So if French people become obsessed with Wine, then all French people will demand relatively more Wine regardless of which country they live in, though this will be moderated somewhat by its availability.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mechanically, availability and the nature of the goods. Luxury goods are more likely to become "fashionable" than Staples, and certain goods might have other intrinsic properties that could make Pops, shall we say, a bit overly enthusiastic about consuming them. But yes, events can also play into this.</p>

<p>Will the governments / private individuals be able to transfer populations? It was quite possible for an investor in 19th century to buy undeveloped land somewhere, then bring in slave workers and start up a plantation/mine/factory. Likewise in the 20th century certain governments also moved whole populations (certainly enough people to constitute an in-game POP) to work and live in various places.  </p>
<p>Also - how will this balance of "large workforce means high production" be affected by growing efficiency of manufacturing when new technologies / machines are introduced?  </p>
<p>Will buildings have individual levels of mechanization/efficiency (i.e. cloth factory A has invested in new looms, so they now produce more but are indebted, whereas cloth factory B has not and produces less per employee but is debt free)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be covered in much more detail in other DDs on the mechanics of Migration, Production Methods, and Slavery. But for now suffice to say that yes, the population will move around within certain bounds to take new jobs, although development of low-populated areas can take some time and work to pay off.  </p>
<p>Pops themselves can actually come in any sizes, from a single working stiff to 100,000 Workforce + 300,000 Dependents or more (for the tech nerds: yes we've repeatedly had to find workarounds for overflowing integers when doing arithmetic involving Pops, as the numbers can get astronomical) and can migrate or switch workplace in similarly variable chunks, no artificial limitations are imposed whereby a Pop is too small or large to move.</p>

<p>Could we perhaps have some game mode where natural mineral resources placement is at least partially randomized? For example if suddenly diamonds or gold is found in Iceland in 1870s - this can lead to a whole new strategic balance in North Atlantic (for example US - UK competition for control over resources). Or what if oil was found not in Ploesti but in Szeged - would this have made Austria-Hungary more competitive in early 20th century - etc., etc.</p>

<p>Some resources like Gold are somewhat randomized if I remember correctly. Will probably be expanded upon in a later dev diary about Resources Smile    :)</p>

<p>Yes, individuals inside a Pop merge with suitable Pops in their destination, and bring their "share" of their properties along with them. So if a part of a poor but literate unemployed Laborer splits off to move to another state, and finds another Laborer Pop of their own culture and religion there that they can merge with (and there's an open spot available for Laborers in the target Pop's workplace) then they will merge with them. The Literacy and Wealth they bring with them (among other properties, like Radicals or Qualifications) will then modify the target Pop proportionally.  </p>
<p>It's all pretty technical and most of the time near-invisible on an individual Pop level, but by being judicious in simulating this stuff we get some very interesting emergent effects like brain drain, itinerant oppressed demographics, geographic wealth shifts, and so on.</p>

<p>Victoria 2 also has this sort of mechanic which ended up allowing otherwise impossible assimilation (e.g. if some colonial state has native farmer pop, sufficiently small number of primary culture farmers moving there would just end up being merged into that non-primary culture pop).

</blockquote>
<p>Pops of different cultures and religions cannot merge in Victoria 3. Assimilation / Conversion splits off part of the Pop, changes the culture/religion, and only merges it if it can find a suitable Pop to merge with.</p>

<p>Currently Tractors have a pre-requisite tech and allows farms to consume Engines &amp; Coal/Oil goods to vastly change the employment structure by employing a few Machinists at the expense of many Laborers and Farmers. So not directly a "Tractor goods" but abstracted into Engines&amp;Coal/Oil. There are a ton of goods as it is so we have to draw the line somewhere.  </p>
<p>It would of course be trivial to mod a Tractor Factory and Tractor goods yourself Smile    :)  </p>

<p>You're the dev here, but I always wondered why don't Paradox's games just simulate a month or two of gameplay (obviously, without war declarations and such) before game start. You usually have to sit idle for some time waiting for all the values to properly initialize anyway, so why not do it behind the scene? Maybe it's what is happening in Vic 3 already though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vicky 2 did actually do this to some extent, and it was the approach we used in early Vicky 3 development as well. It has the downside that since everything is interrelated with the economy, anything you change in history scripts would be out-of-date as the game starts - for example, if I tell the game to make some Wealth 12 Clerks in Missouri at game start, but then the economy runs a few months in the interim, those Clerks might end up Wealth 10 with half of them turning into Farmers before the game starts.  </p>
<p>So at this point in development it's preferable to us to ensure the scripted setup is adhered to at game start, even if that makes for an economically unstable early game. At release we will likely do some limited behind-the-scene iterative pre-ticking (instead of trying to compute an economic equilibrium between this many agents which would be, well I don't want to say impossible, but probably a bit overkill for a video game) but we need to limit what can happen as a result of that - for example we wouldn't want Pops to engage in economic migration prior to game start.</p>

<p>With regards to discoverable resources such as Gold and Oil, they are not totally randomized but rather distributed throughout the world in potential quantities based on our research of actual deposits discovered today. Discovery chances are based on technologies, so it's also influenced by who controls what part of the world.  </p>
<p>From a design perspective we don't actually care if a player wants to pre-emptively capture a part of the world before they would realistically know that part of the world will contain a valuable late-game resource. You wouldn't realistically be able to know in 1836 what technologies would eventually lead you to the capacity to develop Automobiles by the turn of the century either, but we're not hiding or randomizing technology progression for realism's sake.  </p>
<p>That does not mean all regions with potential for Gold or Oil will be guaranteed to manifest that potential by end-game, even if they did so in actual history. If you want to try to pre-empt historical development you do so at your own risk. Personally I think it's more fun to see and react to the economic, political, and diplomatic shake-up of one of these discoveries than to use my knowledge of history strategically to win more, but for those who feel differently it's very easy to mod the removal of potentials from regions that didn't manifest it before 1936 - even impose historical discovery dates if you so wish.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #5 PRODUCTION METHODS</font></p>
<p><strong>Hello again and happy Thursday!</strong> Today we will be taking a deeper look inside <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-3-buildings.1478868/">Buildings</a> to explore Production Methods. These determine the functions of the building, its inputs and outputs, and what employee types it requires to operate.  </p>
<p>Many management games let you upgrade a building to increase its efficiency or expand its functionality. In these games, after the upgrade investment has been paid the impact is permanent and nearly always superior in every way to the building's previous functionality. But in Victoria 3 there are no actions without reactions, and novel innovations don't just make buildings better with no side effects. Improving industrial processes over time is to be expected, but in some cases those improvements might require goods as input that the country has scant access to, while others permit the output of a new type of end product at the expense of the old one. As a result, buildings in Victoria 3 require more flexible upgrade paths than what's afforded by permanent, linear, “no-brainer” improvements.  </p>
<p>All buildings have several categories of Production Methods, usually between 2 and 5. Only one is active at any given time in each category. Most categories fall into one of these types:  </p>
<p><strong>Base:</strong> governs the general "tech level" and efficiency of the building, produces goods typical for the building type  </p>
<p><strong>Refining:</strong> reduces output of typical goods in favor of output of specialized or luxury goods, sometimes adding a special input  </p>
<p><strong>Automation:</strong> adds industrial goods as input to reduce the building's unskilled workforce requirement  </p>
<p><strong>Ownership:</strong> determines who owns shares in the building; typically governed by Laws  </p>
<p><em>With the right technologies Food Industries can make Groceries from both Grain (Bakeries) and Fish (Canneries). They can also refine Grain and Sugar into Liquor (Distilleries). With advanced technologies Food Industries can be partially automated, drastically reducing the need for unskilled labor. Simple Food Industries are operated by Merchant Guilds (Shopkeepers), while more advanced and profitable Food Industries are owned by Capitalists who reinvest some of their dividends.</em>  </p>

<p>As one example, an Iron Mine's base Production Method determines if miners use only picks and shovels or if they also use some sort of engine-driven pumping mechanism. There are several different pumping technologies which also determine what fuel is used. The more advanced the pumping mechanism the more deposits can be accessed and the faster Iron can be mined, but the more Coal or Oil is used in the process. With higher tech pumps comes a requirement for more Engineers and Machinists to be on-site to control and oversee its operation. This creates more demand for qualified workers and also opens up a number of better paid positions to those Pops who meet the qualifications.  </p>
<p>The revolution in chemical sciences of the era also enabled the use of explosives in mining, which is a secondary Production Method category used only in mines. Once Nitroglycerin is invented, it can be used in mines to generate even more minerals, at the expense of Explosives produced by the Chemical Industry but also with a higher rate of workplace accidents. By researching less volatile Dynamite, even more minerals are extracted at the expense of even more Explosives, with the additional benefit that far fewer workers will blow themselves up on the job.  </p>
<p>Once invented, portable Steam Donkey engines can be deployed at mining sites to drastically reduce the amount of manual labor required just for hauling. This costs the building some money in the form of Coal and Engines, but reduces the amount of money they have to pay in wages. Perhaps more importantly it frees those Laborers up to do other work in other buildings if the state is running low on workers. But if wages are already very depressed it might not be a great idea to purchase expensive industrial goods just to increase the unqualified labor pool further, so this might not be a no-brainer decision for a player to make.  </p>
<p>In most countries, simple mines are owned and operated by Merchant Guilds at game start. These are small-time purveyors of the goods produced represented by Shopkeepers. Once mines start to industrialize, Capitalists step in to take over ownership. In most cases these Capitalists will come from Shopkeepers promoted to these newly created positions, but some might come from other Pops in the state, even other Capitalists in buildings not quite as lucrative as these new mines. There are fewer Capitalists than Shopkeepers but they draw a higher wage, and more importantly they will reinvest some of their earnings into the country's expanding industry depending on how much profit their workplace is generating for them. As new ideas spread across your society you might be able to make the mining industry publicly traded instead of privately held, and later on in the game perhaps even nationalize them to be run by government bureaucrats or turn them into cooperatives where profit is split between workers.  </p>

<p>Production Methods aren't limited to consuming and producing goods. Government Administrations employ Bureaucrats and Clerks who use Paper to produce Bureaucracy, one of the game's Capacities that let you govern more people and extend more state services to them. Railways consume Engines and a fuel such as Coal to produce both Transportation and Infrastructure, the former which is sold on the market and the latter which allows the state to support more buildings without loss of Market Access. Universities employ Academics that let the state guide research and development of new technologies and ideas. Virtually any kind of currency, modifier, or effect can be produced by Production Methods in buildings and can be applied in a variety of ways to the country, state, or even the building itself.  </p>
<p><em>A basic Government Administration consumes 10 Paper and produces 50 Bureaucracy per fully-staffed level, but each additional level beyond the first adds a +2% Throughput bonus due to economy of scale. This increases both consumption of Paper and output of Bureaucracy, yielding more productivity from each of the Pops that work the building.</em>  </p>
<p>*<a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%235%20-%20Production%20Methods/dd5_3.png"><img alt="dd5_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%235%20-%20Production%20Methods/dd5_3.png" title="dd5_3.png" /></a></p>

<p>This of course adds a tremendous capacity for modding in new Buildings and Production Methods! Embassies that increase your Influence, but which can also be configured to consume Wine and Meat at state expense to increase the speed at which you Improve Relations? Shantytown Temples that can only be built on coastlines, that consume Fish and create jobs for pops qualifying for the Deep Ones profession, increasing state mortality but also the weekly rate of the global cthulhu_rising counter? We can't wait to see what madness you unleash!  </p>
<p>If tweaking multiple Production Methods across several categories on every single building in the game sounds a bit complex compared to linear building upgrades - you're right! Thankfully we've built a number of tools to help with this process. Foremost among these are the Buildings panel, where you can get an overview of all buildings in your country organized by major and minor type. For example you could get an overview of all Rural buildings, or all Furniture Manufactories, or all Ports. If you have buildings of the same type in several different states, you can break it down further to view the individual building. On each level you can see how profitable the building is and adjust its Production Methods. You can even set all Production Methods for a certain building type to a specific setting all across your country with one click.  </p>
<p><em>From the Buildings panel you can get a birds-eye view of all industries in your country and see at a glance how they’re doing financially. You can change Production Methods on an individual building or on all of them at once. You can even expand buildings directly from this screen if you so choose, or click on one to get an in-depth view of its balance sheet and workforce.</em>  </p>

<p>To minimize the requirement for mental math we have also created prediction tools that give you a breakdown of what to expect from choosing a certain Production Method, based on profitability predictions taking adjusted production and consumption into account, and summarizing which new job positions will be created and which will disappear. While it may on the surface seem obvious to just enable the Production Methods that make the buildings more profitable, keep in mind the societal effects as well - are there enough Pops in the state that qualify for the more advanced jobs this new process requires? Will the wage for these new jobs be sufficient to entice those Pops to switch professions? Will you inadvertently create a whole new class of well-to-do Machinists that may have pro-labor union sentiments? Or will the increased profits not lead to higher wages in the building because they're already competitive and fully employed, and will simply result in more dividends for the shareholders which will be funneled into increased luxury consumption? Which you choose might depend on your population’s social mobility, what politics you favor in your country (a socialist uprising may not be in your plans!) and whether you're able to supply luxuries yourself without benefiting your rival. More profitable domestic industries are never bad, but should be far from the only consideration when building your society.  </p>
<p><em>Predictive tooltips will explain the anticipated impact on the building’s Balance as a result of changes in production, consumption, and wage requirements, as well as the changes in employment that could also impact the country’s politics over time. You will also be forewarned if there aren’t enough qualifying Pops to take on any new professions created, as this could limit your industry’s effectiveness.</em>  </p>

<p>At the moment we're erring on the side of restricting ownership quite strictly, not by government form specifically, but rather by your country's various economic laws. We want the economic laws to feel very distinct and have big impacts on the population, and if we were to permit most of them under all systems this impact wouldn't be felt as strongly. Of course these are balancing decisions and may change before release.  </p>

<p>could I as China flood the market with really cheap goods as I have such a big, unemployed population that it depresses wages down, thus reducing the production cost of the good, thus making the sell price of the good cheaper while still retaining a profit, thus outcompeting goods produced in European countries and putting them out of business?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, assuming the main production cost you have are wages, China's relatively large population will help keep that part of the manufacturing expense down. But if you don't have easy, cheap access to the input goods you need you might not be able to sustain manufacturing the goods cheaply enough to compete with countries that use more technologically advanced, less labor-intensive methods. And then of course there's the additional cost to moving product out of your market, which we'll talk about another time.  </p>

<p>Does this mean that making inputs for one type of industry cheaper will result in higher wages for the workers in that type of industry as they can now put aside more money for wages, thus making all the pops start working in that industry, thus starving my other industries of workers, all because I aquired some cheap inputs for a particular industry? This only works if the industry in question has enough employment capacity through buildings of course. So in that csse upgrading the buildings could be bad?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, assuming as you say that the industry has large enough capacity to absorb all those other workers, it could put other industries out of business as a result. Of course, since this means the supply of the goods those industries produced will decrease while demand will remain high (or even get higher as the mega-industry pays such high wages that Pop wealth and thereby demand increases overall) this should eventually approach an equilibrium where all industries are utilized to some extent.  </p>

<p>As in, Sweden has such a large quantitiy of wood that it the wood price in Sweden is much cheaper than in lets say Britain, thus making the production cost of lumber and subsequently furniture be very cheap, thus being able to flood the British market with very cheap furniture and thus outcompeting and putting British furniture business out of business?</p>

<p>Regarding Economy of Scale and the realistic benefits of centralization v. decentralization: generally we want to encourage centralization through the mechanics because decentralization is already indirectly incentivized through the Infrastructure mechanics (which we haven't talked about in detail yet) and EoS makes for a good strategic counterbalance to that. Since we have no hard caps on the number of different building types you can have in each state you're free to decide if you want to build 1 level 10 Textile Mill in one state or 10 level 1 Textile Mills in 10 states. Without a solid reason to centralize, states don't tend to develop the same kinds of distinct identities which also causes the political gameplay to suffer. So we assume that many (not all) buildings benefit from building tall.</p>

<p>A single state region (e.g. Piedmont) has access to a number of resources (arable land, mining potential, etc) that represents how much it can be exploited and in what ways. A subsection of that state region (e.g. French Piedmont) only gets access to some of those resources, limiting how many jobs can be created there and thereby how large and wealthy the state can get.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the resources transferred in the split different types of buildings would also be transferred, along with the Pops attached to that building.  </p>
<p>It's worth noting here that state regions split only under relatively rare circumstances. Most of the time when territory changes hands it's entire states (which could be a sub-state) from one country to another.</p>

<p>the low infrastructure of the outback is not a limit on how well it receives that administrative input</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not going to get deep into details about this yet, but while low infrastructure is not a limit on how well Bureaucracy is utilized, it does impact the ability for remote Government Administrations to buy Paper from the market at a good price. In effect, without an incentive to centralize, the optimal play strategy would be to construct fully self-sufficient local economies by constructing a variety of building types in every state. This would mean lacking Infrastructure wouldn't matter.  </p>
<p>This is a valid strategy for a number of reasons, but we don't want fully distributed industry to be overwhelmingly optimal as this is neither fun nor realistic. Economy of Scale bonuses simulates how centralization can be beneficial (assuming the Infrastructure is there to optimally deliver input and distribute output goods), makes it easier for the player to keep track of which of their states do what, and makes for more interesting political gameplay, without invalidating a more decentralized strategy or artificially limiting the number of building types by "slots" or similar. We think it works pretty well.</p>

<p>State size varies since they're intended to mostly follow historical cultural/legal/administrative boundaries rather than be based on geography or target size. Territorial changes where a state changes hands can very well be big and sudden, yes. That is fully intentional, since the game is not about slow and steady expansion of territory but rather slow and steady growth inside your borders and major upheaval as one potential outcome of conquest. Of course the Pops in the states always change over time, though.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #6 INTEREST GROUPS</font></p>
<p>Hello once again and welcome back to yet another Victoria 3 dev diary. Where previous dev diaries have been focusing on the economy, we’re now going to switch gears to another core pillar of the Victoria series - internal politics! More specifically, we’re going to be talking about Interest Groups, which form the nucleus of Victoria 3’s political gameplay.  </p>
<p>What then, are Interest Groups? Fundamentally, an Interest Group is a collection of pops that espouse certain political views and want to change the country to be more in line with those views. Interest Groups are drawn from a number of different templates, but will vary in their exact views from country to country, based on factors such as the local religion, which social movements have appeared in the country or the personal views of their leader.  </p>
<p><em>The Landowners is an Interest Group dominated by the Aristocracy and tends to be firmly in the conservative side of politics</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%236%20-%20Interest%20Groups/dd6_1.png"><img alt="dd6_1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%236%20-%20Interest%20Groups/dd6_1.png" title="dd6_1.png" /></a></p>

<p>As mentioned, Interest Groups are fundamentally made up of Pops - all individuals in all Pops are either members of an Interest Group or Politically Inactive, with the ratio in each based on factors such as Profession, Wealth, Literacy etc. Individuals inside Pops contribute Political Strength to their Interest Group of choice, with the amount they contribute again dependent on multiple factors, the main ones being their material Wealth and the status (and/or votes!) they are offered under the nation’s power structure.  </p>
<p>For example, a single wealthy Aristocrat in an Oligarchy will provide hundreds or even thousands times the political strength of a poor laborer. The total Political Strength of all Pops in an Interest Group is what gives it its level of Clout - the amount of political weight it can assert on the country and the government. It’s important to note though that Pops are not unified in which Interest Groups they support - individuals within Pops are the ones who decide their Interest Group, and a single Pop can potentially have individuals supporting every Interest Group in the game (in different numbers).  </p>
<p>Some Pops have no political strength at all, usually due to being disenfranchised under the nation’s laws (such as people of a religion or culture that is discriminated against, or women in countries that haven’t instituted women’s suffrage). These Pops are ‘outside the system’ so to speak, unable to demand reform through the regular political system of Interest Groups, and instead having to rely on other methods to put pressure on the government, but we won’t focus on those today.  </p>
<p><em>Individual members of a Pop can support different Interest Groups - or stay out of politics altogether!</em>  </p>

<p>As mentioned above, Interest Groups have a number of ideologies which determine their views on which laws the country should or should not enact. Different Interest Groups will have different ideologies (the Landowners are significantly more conservative than the Trade Unions, for example - shocking, I know!) but these are not entirely set in stone - they can change over the course of the game and will also vary based on the current leader of the Interest Group, who comes with his or her own personal ideology and view of the world. Additionally, some Interest Groups in certain countries have unique ideologies colored by their religion and culture, such as the Confucian Scholars Interest Group in Qing China who (unsurprisingly) espouse a Confucian ideology.  </p>
<p><em>Interest Groups will generally favor laws that benefit them in some way</em>  </p>

<p>I mentioned previously that Interest Groups have a level of Clout based on the total Political Strength of their constituent Pops. Clout is calculated by comparing their Political Strength to that of the other Interest Groups in the country - if all the Interest Groups in Belgium put together have 100k Political Strength and the Landowners have 30k, they correspondingly get 30% of the Clout in Belgium. The Interest Group’s Clout will determine their classification - Powerful, Influential or Marginalized.  </p>
<p>Interest Groups also have a level of Approval, which is based on factors such as how much they approve of the country’s laws, whether they are in government or in opposition, and how many of their individual members are Loyalists or Radicals (more on those in a later dev diary). There are numerous other factors that can affect Approval as well, such as how you react to certain events or decisions that you take.  </p>
<p>Together, the classification and Approval of an Interest Group determines which Traits are active for an Interest Group at any given time, and how impactful they are. There are different traits, positive and negative, with positive traits being activated when an Interest Group is happy and negative ones when they are… not so happy. If an Interest Group is Powerful, the effects of any traits they have active (good or bad) are stronger, while an Interest Group that is Marginalized cannot activate traits at all, as they are too weak to exert an effect on the whole country.  </p>
<p>Traits are, of course, not the only way that Interest Groups can affect a country, and it’s even possible for one (or several!) angry Interest Groups to start a civil war, potentially bringing in foreign countries to support them.  </p>
<p><em>Keep the aristocracy happy, and they’ll be more willing to reinvest their ‘hard-earned’ money into the country</em>  </p>

<p>Now, something that’s been a hotly debated topic in the community in regards to Interest Groups is Political Parties and whether they will be a part of Victoria 3 so I want to briefly touch on this. What I can tell you for now is that we are currently looking into a solution where parties can form in certain countries as constellations of Interest Groups holding a shared political platform. This is something that’s by no means fully nailed down at this point though, so don’t take this as a 100% firm commitment to how they would function. What I can tell you for sure is that we will come back to this particular topic later!  </p>
<p>That’s all for today, though we’ll certainly be coming back to the subject of Interest Groups and looking at the different types you will encounter in later dev diaries. With July and summer vacations coming up, we’re going to take a short break from Development Diaries, but we’ll be back on July 22nd as Mikael returns to continue talking about politics in Victoria 3, on the subject of Laws.</p>

<p>Hi, I have a question since yesterday:  </p>
<p>I came to wonder why marginalized groups don't have their interest groups. We did after all have abolitionists and suffragettes (I understand that we didn't necessarily have abolitionist pressure groups comprised of slaves haha, but suffragettes are (?) the same as any interest group). So as far as I understand interest groups are not 1:1 with pressure groups?  </p>
<p>I like that other interest groups can have anti-slavery ideology though (which is true to history)!</p>

<p>We have a different way of handling single issue pressure groups that we'll get into later.</p>

<p>France would have Wealth Voting under our systems (which requires Wealth 20 or higher to vote), though we could also add a lower wealth voting threshold to Census Suffrage.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's not what I meant. High Literacy = more political participation. High Literacy + poor Laborer frustrated they have no voice in government and police beat them when they try to organize = more political participation by people who want more liberal reforms.  </p>
<p>Public Schools causing increased attraction for government Interest Group is a neat idea, thanks!</p>

<h1><a href="self.source">Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #7 - Laws</a></h1>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%237%20-%20Laws/dd7.png"><img alt="dd7.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%237%20-%20Laws/dd7.png" title="dd7.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #7 LAwS</font></p>
<p>After a couple weeks vacation, we’ve now returned to our usual weekly dev diary schedule! Today we will be diving deeper into Victoria’s politics to talk about Laws. Legal reform in your country creates different political, economic, and social conditions for your Pops, which over time changes the fabric of your society. This change can be slow and incremental, or fast and revolutionary - sometimes literally.  </p>
<p>There are three major categories of Laws with seven sub-categories in each, which themselves contain up to half a dozen specific Law options. As always everything here is being heavily iterated upon, including these sub-categories, so the laws you see at release will not exactly match what we’re telling you here!  </p>
<p><strong>Power Structure</strong>  </p>
<p>These Laws determine who is in control of different aspects of your country. It includes fundamental Governance Principles such as Monarchy and Parliamentary Republic, which determine who your Head of State is and what kind of powers they wield. Distribution of Power ranges from Autocracy and Oligarchy through various extensions of the voting franchise all the way to Universal Suffrage. Citizenship and Church and State Laws govern which Pops suffer legal discrimination in your country due to their culture or religion. The principles on which your Bureaucracy is run - such as hereditary or elected positions for bureaucrats - determine how expensive it is to keep track of each citizen and how much Institutions cost to run, but also directly benefit some groups over others. Conscription lets you raise a part of your civilian workforce as soldiers in times of war, and Internal Security governs how the Home Affairs anti-insurgent Institution works.  </p>
<p>*The Power Structure Laws of a typical European nation after having made a few strides towards liberalization. The numbers in green refers to the number of alternative Laws currently available to be enacted. This indicator is used throughout the UI to reveal how many options a sub-menu has without having to open it.  </p>

​</em><em>Economy</em>*  </p>
<p>This set of Laws define where your treasury’s money comes from and how it can be spent. Your Economic System is crucial - this governs whether your country operates on principles of Mercantilism, Isolationism, or Free Trade, among others. Income Tax determines which Pops should be taxed and what range of tax burden is appropriate. No Income Tax at all is of course an option, and legislation to such effect will make some Pops both rich and happy! Poll Taxation, or levying a fixed tax per head, is another option primarily used in less industrialized societies. (There are other avenues of taxation as well, but these are the ones driven by legislation.) Finally, you can choose what form the Institutions of Colonization, Policing, Education System, and Health System will take in your country. For example, you can keep government spending under control by instituting Charity Hospitals, which have limited effect and boost the power of the clergy, or you could pass a Public Health Insurance Law which is costlier but can have a greater impact on the health of the masses.  </p>
<p>*Payroll Taxes require reasonable lower-class wages and a centralized population to pay off, but if so can form the economic basis for a budding welfare system as seen here. A tax system based on Levying might be more lucrative in countries with huge Peasant populations.  </p>

​</em><em>Human Rights</em>*  </p>
<p>Enshrining the rights of the individual was a hallmark of the era. These Laws define how your Pops are treated and what manner of control you can enforce over their lives. Free Speech determines the degree of control you can enforce over your Interest Groups but restrictive rights throttle the spread of innovation. The Labor Rights Laws include outlawing serfdom, but extends all the way to establishing a Workplace Safety Institution to reduce the number of people literally crushed in the jaws of industry. Children’s Rights and the Rights of Women have a number of effects such as shifting the Workforce/Dependent demographics, affecting Dependent income, and extending the franchise. Welfare ensures the poor and disabled in your society are taken care of. Migration Laws can be used to influence Pop migration. Slavery Laws determine the legal status of owning people in your country. More details on that subject in a future dev diary.  </p>
<p><em>Not a lot of concessions have been made here, but at least children may congregate freely after the factory whistle signals the end of their grueling workday.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%237%20-%20Laws/dd7_3.png"><img alt="dd7_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%237%20-%20Laws/dd7_3.png" title="dd7_3.png" /></a></p>

<p>​Laws are almost always completely independent from one another. You can create a Constitutional Monarchy with hereditary succession but Universal Suffrage, or an Autocratic Presidential Republic with a strongman leader at the top of the food chain. You can have a Secret Police and still permit fully Protected Speech.  </p>
<p>Our aim is to set all countries up with the best fitting Laws compared to what they actually had in 1836. This will vary wildly between countries, and will greatly influence what sorts of conditions and strategies are available to you at the start of the game. For example, the USA starts with Total Separation of Church and State, ensuring no Pops suffer legal discrimination on account of their religion, while Sardinia-Piedmont doesn’t take kindly to non-Catholic Pops. This will affect Pops who live in the country currently, but will also limit which Pops might migrate there - few Pops would make it their preference to move to a country where they’re mistreated by law.   </p>
<p>As a result of these starting Laws Sardinia-Piedmont might have to look towards colonization or conquest if they start to run out of their native workforce, while North America is likely to get regular migration waves to help expand the frontier. By connecting these effects to starting Laws, many historically appropriate and recognizable aspects and behaviors of Victorian-era nations - such as their attractiveness to immigrants - are connected to a tangible property (e.g. poor or oppressed Pops emigrating to the USA both because of its demand for workforce and also its liberal Laws) rather than being arbitrarily encoded into the very fabric of the nation itself, the approach previous Victoria games took to encourage history in the a familiar direction.  </p>
<p>However, these starting Laws are far from set in stone! You might want to reform your Laws to better suit the direction your society is going - for example, you might want to transition your Bureaucracy from a system of Appointees to Elected Bureaucrats in order to more effectively provide services from Government Institutions to all your incorporated territories (or maybe just because you want to disempower the otherwise powerful Intelligentsia.) Or your country’s Agrarian economy has plateaued on account of increased reliance on imports of manufactured goods, and you want to change course to the exciting opportunities provided by a Free Trade policy.  </p>
<p>*A common effect of Laws is to modify some parameter about your country, like give you more Authority or reduce certain Pops’ Mortality. But Laws can also permit or disallow the use of certain actions, such as Public Schools which permit the Compulsory Primary School Law; permit the Decree to Promote Social Mobility in a certain state; and even alter the effects of other parts of your society, like boost the efficacy of your Education System Institution. Without some degree of separation between Church and State, this form of secular school system is not possible.  </p>

​Another reason to change Laws is because your people demand it. As we touched on in the previous dev diary, Interest Groups have Ideologies that lead them to favor some Laws over others - for example, the Industrialists have the Individualist Ideology that cause them to favor privately operated Education and Healthcare systems over publicly funded ones, to ensure best access is given to those of merit and morals (or in other words, Wealth). Reforming your current Laws to work more in accordance with your powerful Interest Groups’ Ideologies is a quick way to win their Approval, permitting you more leeway to go against their wishes in the future or as a quick pick-me-up in case their Standard of Living has recently taken a hit.  </p>
<p>The inverse is also true. Introduce a bill to abolish the Monarchy in Great Britain and see how the Landed Gentry feel about that.  </p>
<p>*Even Trade Unionists have a hard time saying no to zero income taxes, but even that won’t make up for restricting the vote!  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%237%20-%20Laws/dd7_6.png"><img alt="dd7_6.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%237%20-%20Laws/dd7_6.png" title="dd7_6.png" /></a></p>

​Enacting a Law is far from an instantaneous, one-click affair. First off, any reform must be supported by at least one Interest Group in your government who can champion the change. Once the reform has begun it can be a smooth process that’s over in a matter of months, or it can take years of gruelling debate in parliament or horsetrading between Interest Groups in order to pass. The amount of time it takes depends both on your government’s Legitimacy in the eyes of the people, and also on the Clout of the Interest Groups in your government that supports and opposes the new Law relative to the one it’s replacing. While broader coalitions of Interest Groups in government give you more options of Laws to enact, it also complicates getting them passed.  </p>
<p>*Changing your laws isn’t an entirely straightforward process in Victoria 3! In this case it’s just a matter of time before the Law is enacted, but if dissenting Interest Groups had also been part of this government there would be plenty of room for Debate and Stalling tactics that could cause this reform to take more effort than it’s worth.  </p>

​Let me close out here by tying all this back to the Pops. As we have touched on in past dev diaries, Pops have a Profession, collect an income, and consume goods depending on the economic preconditions you have created in your country. These material concerns in combination with a few others, such as Literacy, determine which Interest Groups they support. Other aspects, such as your country’s Laws, influence how much Political Strength the Pops provide to those Interest Groups. The Interest Groups have an Approval score and favor certain Laws over others. As a result, different groups of Pops approve more or less of the society you have built depending on their economic well-being, and their demands for change is more or less intimidating depending on how many and strong they are. You may choose to placate an angry group, or further benefit an already content group for extra benefits. But in doing so, some other group will become displeased. Have you built your society resilient enough to navigate these ebbs and flows? And most importantly, which of the many, many routes will you take to move forward?  </p>
<p>That is all for me this week! In this dev diary I mentioned Institutions a number of times, and next Thursday I will be back with more details on this powerful society-shaping tool. Until then!</p>

<p>Since the process of enacting laws has been drawn out, do you know beforehand roughly how long it would take to get it passed? Other than knowing how much support or opposition there is for it does the game also tell you an estimated date for when it should be fully enacted and in force? Want to know if it's just a guessing game for the player or if we have a more precise idea of how long the process might take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the two parameters "Time to next check" and "Success chance" should gives you a pretty reasonable idea how long the process <em>might</em> take if nothing changes, events arising from the "Advance", "Debate", and "Stall" outcomes could very well upset this. This feature is being worked on at the moment, but our intention is that if the law doesn't pass, there should be an opportunity for a trade-off or consequence. Perhaps a neutral Interest Group would be willing to support this law in exchange for a promise to pass their pet law next, for example. So since the parameters will change relatively drastically, a prediction of what would happen if nothing changed would be misleading information.</p>

<p>Here's a few questions I've gathered while reading the DD:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After the the reform has passed for say, the public schools - what happens next? Do private/religious schools momentarily get nationalized or is there an adaptation period?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In DD it is stated that one of the reasons for enacting bureaucracy reforms is to disempower the intelligentsia. How does that happen?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the new law has passed, the change to the Institution happens instantly. The time to enact the law is waiting time enough, if we had an additional "implementation" delay before you could reap the fruits of your labor wouldn't feel great. With respect to Institutions though, there is often a period right after it's been created where you have to expand it for full effect, which does take time. I'll get into more details on that next week.  </p>
<p>A side effect of the Bureaucracy laws is to empower one group over another as members of that group are given the responsibility to run the country's day-to-day operations. Appointed Bureaucrats disproportionately empower the Intelligentsia, so enacting another kind of Bureaucracy would remove their bonus (and maybe apply it to another group instead.)</p>

<p>You say that process of passing laws depends on what interest groups you have in government, and how many. But in the diary about interest groups there was no info about what determines, which interest groups are part of government. Can player control it or influence it? To what extent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll talk about government composition more in the future, but the player basically decides - within considerable constraints - which Interest Groups are permitted to run the country and which are left on the outside as pressure groups. At game start there will be a certain set of Interest Groups in government, but as the game progresses the player might want to include or exclude different groups depending on how powerful they are and how well they align with their own ideas of governance. If the people are given the vote the player's ability to choose freely who should govern will be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Now here's a question I really need answered: In Victoria II, Liberals were interested in changing political laws but not economic laws, while Socialists were interested in changing economic laws but not political laws, which led to weird situations like Socialists being a-okay with Slavery and letting rich people vote, but not poor people. Has this been changed to at least make more sense? Will Socialists be pushing for universal vote and the abolition of slavery?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Interest Group start with 2-3 "core" Ideologies and can gain 1-2 more, sometimes temporarily depending on which politician / faction are currently leading them. For example, the Intelligentsia will care about somewhat different things if there's a socialist revolutionary leading them than if the academies are dominated by a conservative aristocratic mindset. Each Ideology has stances on 1-4 different law groups. Moralists, for example, have ideas about Governance Principles, Free Speech, Citizenship, and the Health System, and as such cross all three categories of Laws.</p>

<p>It varies, but we've tried to minimize the number of law groups where the laws just move the needle from one side of a spectrum to another in favor of ones where each has some unique tradeoff. In the case of Serfdom it's in the Labor Rights group within the Human Rights category, so while the effects between the different laws are very different gameplay-wise it pretty much requires that laborers have the basic human right of free movement and free employment if you intend to also grant them the luxury of government oversight of how their employers are treating them.</p>

<p>(snipped out the actual graphics)  </p>
<p>These are actually three columns on the same screen, I just hacked it to pieces for the dev diary. Smile    :)  </p>
<p>In many cases we've tried to stay away from full-screen interfaces though, since we want to ensure the map is also visible and to relate as much as possible in the panels to the map. In the case of laws, there's no map information to display and players will often want to consider <em>all</em> their laws side by side rather than one category at a time, so there we've used a full-screen interface.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Internal Security is mainly about preventing revolutions and other uprisings, while Policing is about keeping unrest down and minimizing its effects on your economy and living standards. The two are somewhat interrelated but help in two different contexts: your National Guard isn't going to help with petty theft, and your police force isn't going to be useful in preventing a coup.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that case, there'd be no difference between the two laws in practice.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the law doesn't get passed a new enactment cycle will start immediately, hopefully with a bonus to your next attempt. It's up to you when you decide it's too hard to pass it and stop trying.</p>

<h1><a href="self.source">Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #8 - Institutions</a></h1>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd8.png"><img alt="dd8.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd8.png" title="dd8.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: cVCTORI DEV DIARY #8 TNSTITUTIONS</font></p>
<p>Let’s talk about Government Institutions! These are the “services” your government provides to its Pops - and I use scare quotes here because while that does certainly include things like schools and workplace safety controls, it also means conscription offices, militarized police, and poorhouses.  </p>
<p>While Laws are political hot buttons with your Interest Groups, Institutions are a side effect of those Laws, and it’s not as politically fraught to expand your pre-existing health care system as it is to establish or dismantle it. But the Laws that bring an Institution into existence also govern what side effects they have, and Interest Groups will care a lot about those.  </p>
<p>As we all know, Institutions run on Bureaucracy like gamers run on caffeine (I would have said “cars run on gas”, but that isn’t universally true anymore, is it?). Bureaucracy comes from Government Administration buildings, which employ Clerks and Bureaucrats that consume Paper (and later on other goods, like Telephones) in the process. The more Government Administration buildings you have, the more and larger Institutions you can operate at once.  </p>
<p><em>Running a positive Bureaucracy balance is great for remaining responsive to your people’s evolving needs. In the meantime, any excess Bureaucracy will be used to marginally improve construction efforts around your country.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd08_1.png"><img alt="dd08_1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd08_1.png" title="dd08_1.png" /></a></p>

<p>The cost of Institutions, or the cost of one level of an Institution, is dependent on the size of the population across your Incorporated states. An important aspect of Institutions is that the effects and benefits they apply only affect Incorporated parts of your country - if you have any colonial frontiers, contested territory, or recently annexed land you haven’t Incorporated yet, these do not pay taxes to you nor do they cost you Bureaucracy, but they also can’t access your awesome hospitals.  </p>
<p><em>Ways of decreasing the cost of providing Institutions to your people include:</em>  </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Passing Laws to decentralize your Bureaucracy with elected rather than appointed officials</em></li>
<li><em>Society inventions like Behaviorism that provide insight into people management</em></li>
<li><em>Refraining from Incorporating colonies and conquered territories</em></li>
<li><em>Sending a whole bunch of people to their deaths in terrible wars (warning: side effects may vary)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd08_2.png"><img alt="dd08_2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd08_2.png" title="dd08_2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Education Number of Investment Levels 5 +30.0% Education Access +60.0% Conversion +60.0% Devout Political Strength Bureaucracy Cost Investment Level 22.8 Bureaucracy Cost Investment evel: 22.8 Incorporated Population of 1.98M costs 22.8 per Investment Base Cost: 19.8 +15.00% from Hereditary Bureaucrats Weekly Cost 114.1</font></p>
<p>Currently planned Institutions are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>School System - educates your populace</li>
<li>Health System - increases your population health</li>
<li>Police - decreases the effects of Turmoil</li>
<li>Workplace Safety - reduces workplace mortality</li>
<li>Social Security - impacts how poor your population can get</li>
<li>Home Affairs - counteracts revolutionary sentiment</li>
<li>Conscription - lets you recruit civilians as conscripts during wartime</li>
<li>Colonial Affairs - advances your colonial frontiers</li>
</ul>
<p>To establish these Institutions you have to have sufficient Bureaucracy for their operation, and then enact an enabling Law. There are always several different Laws that enable a certain Institution, and which you choose will “flavor” the Institution accordingly. For example, the Colonial Affairs Institution will generate colonial growth in all your established colonies in relation to the size of your Incorporated population, by encouraging people to move and invest there. But if you have the Colonial Resettlement Law each level of it will also provide increased colonial migration pull to entice your population to move there, while the Colonial Exploitation Law will increase the throughput of colonial industries while reducing the Standard of Living of Pops who live there.  </p>
<p><em>Switzerland has 3 levels of Religious Schools, 1 level of Local Law Enforcement, and 1 level of a Private Health System with a second level currently in progress.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd08_3.png"><img alt="dd08_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%238%20-%20Institutions/dd08_3.png" title="dd08_3.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Education +30.0% Education Access 60.0% Conversion 60.0% Devout Political Strength Law Enforcement +10.0% Landowners Political Strength 20.0% State Penalties from Turmoil Health System 1.0%0 Wealth Mortality (Wealth-based)</font></p>
<p>The Bureaucracy you invest into Institutions can be redistributed as needed, but this takes time. For example, if you have a level 3 Health System and level 2 Home Affairs, and a per-level cost of 142 Bureaucracy, you’re paying 710 Bureaucracy for the privilege which you have to generate from Government Administration buildings. But if your population grows such that each level costs 173 instead, maintaining these levels will cost you 865. Assuming this puts you at a deficit of -155 Bureaucracy, you will suffer a pretty hefty Tax Waste penalty, which causes a percentage of all taxes collected to never quite make it all the way to your treasury.  </p>
<p>In response to this disaster you may be forced to reduce the level of one of these Institutions, which will restore your Bureaucracy balance to +18 while you expand your bureaucracy to be able to regain the lost level. If you took the level from the Health System, your Pops will suffer reduced health in the interim, while if you reduce Home Affairs, you better hope you have no anarchist bomb-throwers lurking around in the shadows. Since Institutions expand gradually, restoring your lost level will take some time, so if possible it’s best to stay ahead of the change and expand your Government Administration proactively if you experience strong population growth or immigration waves to your incorporated states.  </p>
<p>That’s all for Institutions! Until next week!</p>

<p>There are a number of different Laws that can enable the Health System Institutions, which are supported by different Interest Groups. For example, the Industrialists support a Private Health System. It's also quite common that Institutions enabled under one administration remain after that administration drastically changes, for example after an election. The new government is on the hook to support the existing Institution with its current properties, although they may be inclined to change the laws such that they operate more along their own ideology.</p>

<p>If you conquer land with Government Administrations, you can use these to expand your existing Institutions.

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27704799">lachek reqplied to Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #8 - Institutions</a></h4>
<p>As it's come up a few times I want to address the feedback that certain Institutions, like schools and hospitals, are more suited to being Buildings than nation-wide Institutions.  </p>
<p>There is nothing fundamental in the game's core mechanics that prevents this. Institutions have an effect on states, and Buildings can be scripted to have the exact same effect on states. Furthermore, Buildings can take varied input goods (such as medicine for hospitals and small arms for police stations) and require varied Pop professions, such that building Hospitals could employ more Academics (Doctors) than Bureaucrats, and so on. A modder could replace any Institution in the game with the equivalent set of Buildings with no adverse side effects in a couple of hours. Buildings can require Laws in order to be constructed and have Production Methods that can only be turned on during different Laws, so all of the functionality in the current system can be ported over to the Buildings system. So why haven't we done this?  </p>
<p>There are a number of reasons, actually. The foremost of them is that <em>enacting a Law is a promise</em>. If the Petit-Bourgeoisie are upset at the lack of Police and Poor Houses to keep the rabble off the streets, they'll be pleased when you enact a Law that enable these Institutions, and once enabled you have to pass a Law to abolish it to get rid of it and its administrative costs. If we instead had a Police Station building and a Poor House building then the P-Bs would be pleased once the Laws that permits you to build them are passed, but you're under no obligation to build and pay for them. This is pretty cheesy and creates a disconnect between the political gameplay and the economic gameplay.  </p>
<p>Another, related, aspect is that Bureaucracy is intended to discourage sprawl and reward countries who choose to build tall. If you're a militaristic superpower who aggress your way across a continent, you're going to have a hard time extending all these guaranteed government services to your newly annexed lands. "Incorporation" of a state is a permanent choice of declaring a state an official core part of your nation, thereby taxing the population in exchange for extending all your Institutions to them. All this costs Bureaucracy, so smaller, tighter countries have a much easier time providing services to their population than vast empires do. Again, this dynamic doesn't work if you can just choose who gets access to how many government services and who doesn't.  </p>
<p>The final major reason is the large amounts of frankly boring micro this would require many countries to engage in. Chances are very good that once you have a Health System you're going to want to extend its function to at least most of your states. Spamming Hospitals in every state and then keeping up on what level they are in order to ensure they provide the right amount of health care to all the people who live there sounds awesome on paper, is a terrible game experience for larger countries, and frankly isn't a very interesting choice. Now multiply this experience with all the different Institutions you'd rather have as Buildings.  </p>
<p>Having said all this the system <em>is</em> very flexible, and if we find in playtest that, the above reasons notwithstanding, a certain Institution would in fact work better as a Building it is relatively easy to rework it!</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cICTORIA DEV DIARY #9 NATIONAL MARKETS</font></p>
<p>Hello again! Today we will dig into Victoria 3’s National Market system. Markets are what drives the game’s dynamic economy by determining a rational price based on supply and demand for all trade goods in every state throughout the world. Expanding your national market to encompass more territory means more raw resources for your furnaces and more customers for your manufacturing industries. As your industrial base grows, so does your demand for infrastructure to bring goods to market.  </p>
<p><em>The French market is swimming in cheap Luxury Furniture, Porcelain, Fruit, and Meat. Luxury Clothes and Wine are well-balanced. But as far as luxuries go, Sugar in particular has a sizable deficit and securing a reliable source of that would likely result in improved supply of domestic distilled Liquor as well.</em>  </p>

<p>By default every country is in control of its own market which is typically (but not always) centered on their capital state. Every state connected to this market capital - overland or by sea through ports - is also part of the market. These states all have a variable degree of <em>Market Access</em> representing how well-connected they are to every other state in the market. Market Access is based on Infrastructure, which we will talk more about in next week’s development diary!  </p>
<p>All local consumption and production in states contribute to the market’s Buy Orders and Sell Orders. Think of these as orders on a commodity market: higher consumption of Grain will cause traders to submit more Grain Buy Orders while higher production of Silk will result in more Sell Orders for Silk.  </p>
<p><em>Furniture is a popular commodity with the growing urban lower middle-class, and it’s not likely its price in the French Market will drop anytime soon. Assuming the appropriate raw materials remain in good supply, upsizing this market’s Furniture industry is a safe bet.</em>  </p>

​As we discussed in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-4-goods.1479730/#post-27621780">Goods</a> development diary, all goods have a </em>base price*. This is the price it would fetch given ideal market conditions: all demand is fulfilled perfectly with available supply, with zero goods produced in excess of demand. If buildings produce more than is being demanded each unit produced will be sold at a depressed price. This benefits consumers at the detriment of producers. Conversely, if demand is higher than supply, the economy of buildings producing those goods will be booming while Pops and buildings that rely on that goods to continue operating will be overpaying.  </p>
<p>When determining prices for goods across a market’s many states we start by determining a <em>market price</em>. This is based on the balance between a market’s Buy and Sell Orders, with the base price as a baseline. The more Buy Orders than Sell Orders the higher the price will be and vice versa. Buy and Sell Orders submitted to the market are scaled by the amount of Market Access the state has. This means a state with underdeveloped infrastructure will trade less with the market and rely more on locally available goods.  </p>
<p>States with full Market Access will use the market price for all its goods. Otherwise only part of the market price can be used, with the remainder of the <em>local price</em> made up by the local consumption and production of the goods. All actual transactions are done in local prices, with market prices acting to moderate local imbalances proportional to Market Access.  </p>
<p><em>Glass is overproduced in Orsha. Coupled with a suffering Market Access in Orsha this means the Glassworks there can’t sell at the somewhat high market norm for their goods. This works out fine for local Pops and Urban Centers who consume it as they get to pay less than market price. But continuing to expand the Glassworks in Orsha will only lead to worsening Market Access for all local industries, and won’t lead to a better price of Glass anywhere else since fewer and fewer of Orsha’s Glass Sell Order ends up reaching the market. We can see this development on the market price chart: the market price used to be high due to low supply, we started expanding the Glassworks in Orsha which lowered the market price, until the point Orsha’s expanding industry became a bottleneck and prices started to rise again. The last few expansions have done nothing to lower the market price even as the local price has been steadily dropping.</em>  </p>

<p>If an oversupply becomes large enough, the selling price will be so low producers will be unable to keep wages and thereby production volume up unless they’re receiving government subsidies. But oversupply is not remotely as bad as when goods are grossly undersupplied, which causes a shortage. Goods being in shortage leads to terrible effects for those in your market who rely on it; for example, drastically decreased production efficiency of buildings that rely on it as an input. Shortages demand immediate action, whether that be fast-tracking expanding your own domestic production, importing it from other markets, or expanding your market to include prominent producers of the goods.  </p>

<p>Astute observers familiar with previous Victorias will note there are no goods stockpiles involved in this system. In the predecessor game a single unit of a goods would be produced, sold, traded, perhaps refined, stored, and ultimately consumed, with global price development determined by how many units are inserted into or removed from the world’s total supply. In Victoria 3, a single unit of goods is produced and immediately sold at a price determined by how many consumers are willing to buy it at the moment of production. When this happens prices shift right away along with actual supply and demand, and trade between markets is modelled using Buy and Sell Orders. This more open economic model is both more responsive to sudden economic shifts and less prone to mysterious systemic failures where all the world’s cement might end up locked inside a warehouse in Missouri. Any stockpiling in the system is represented as cash (for example through a building’s Cash Reserves or a country’s Treasury) or as Pop Wealth, which forms the basis for Standard of Living and determines their level of consumption.  </p>
<p>As the econ nerds (you know who you are) will by now have intuited, this lack of goods stockpiling in turn implies that in Victoria 3 we have moved away from the fixed global money supply introduced in Victoria 2. The main reason for this is simply due to how many limitations such a system places on what we can do with the economy in the game. With Victoria 2’s extremely restrictive and technically challenging closed market and world market buying order, it simply wouldn’t have been possible to do things such as Goods Substitution, Trade Routes, dynamic National Markets, transportation costs for Goods and so on in the ways we have, either due to incompatibilities in the design, or simply because it couldn’t possibly be made performant. We believe that the complexity, responsive simulation, and interesting gameplay added by this approach more than make up for what we lose.  </p>
<p>Finally, a small teaser of something we will be talking more about once we get around to presenting the diplomatic gameplay. As you may have gleaned from the top screenshot, it <em>is</em> possible for several countries to participate in a single market. Sometimes this is the result of a Customs Union Pact led by the more powerful nation but more often it’s because of a subject relationship with a puppet or semi-independent colonies. In certain cases countries can even own a small plot of land inside someone else’s market, such as a Treaty Port. The route to expanding your country’s economic power is not only through increasing domestic production and consumption, but also through diplomatic and/or military means.  </p>
<p><em>The Zollverein, or German Customs Union, is a broad unified market of German states controlled by Prussia. Without such a union many smaller German countries would find their economies too inefficient and trade opportunities severely hampered by geography and lack of access to naval trade.</em>  </p>

<p>That’d be true if base price is close to equilibrium price, but it can’t be so for all markets and all technology levels. If the base price is enough to keep pre-Bessemer steel mill barely profitable, it should generate huge margin for an EAF mill, so EAF will be able to cope with constantly insufficient demand and low prices and still pay decent wages. Or am I understanding the system wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, you got it right! And yes, pre-Bessemer Steel Mills are barely profitable (prime candidate for subsidizing if you want to be an early Steel-producing power) while late-game Steel Mills can be very profitable indeed. However, those late-game Steel Mills also require expensive input goods as well as more qualified and higher paid employees, and by that point any decent economy would have seen average wages inflate quite a bit compared to 1836. Since buildings compete with each other for workers what is considered a "decent wage" changes over time, and the high potential productivity of late-game Steel Mills can only be realized with access to cheap advanced input goods.</p>

<p>To clarify: situation where "machine tools"(tm) good produced at let's say 10 units, demand is 20 (assuming it is below shortage treshold), the world can operate as if 20 units are actually produced, for as long as buyers can afford high price?I'm especially interested in the case of state, since state can have a very deep pockets. But, are 10 or 20 units actually available, and if 20, whom pockets the difference, for those 10 units that were not produced, but we're bought from somewhere?  </p>
<p>In V2, there was a curious dynamic, where you had to create machine tools factories, or your chance of rapid industrialization was zero. Market simply would have supply to actually build those factories.  </p>
<p>In V3, that wouldn't be the issue. As long as I'm willing to she'll out extra cash, I can industrialize Russia in 1936, and for a few years the world will just create machine tools out of thin air, for me, right?  </p>
<p>Then, question, where will that money go? Or does not closed system also means that money can be payed out into thin air for goods provided from it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have <em>zero</em> access to Tools, the shortage mechanic will ensure you cannot industrialize.  </p>
<p>If you have <em>some</em> access to Tools but your demand for it is somewhat higher than that, you will be paying a lot more to industrialize than your more capable competitors. The premium you're paying for Tools will go to your Tool-producing industries and the Pops who own them. If your Tool supply come from imports, it means greater profits for Tool-producers in the exporting countries.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I don't quite understand why such things couldn't be modeled in the old system. Could you give some examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One fundamental example is that when supply is insufficient, you have to distribute it between prospective purchasers by some rational mechanism. So when you have a Steel Mill and 100 Pops who all want to buy Coal, who gets to purchase what fraction of the available supply?  </p>
<p>Option 1: Determine some priority sequence, e.g. buildings always buy first, then Pops buy in order of descending Wealth. This means the Steel Mills might buy up all available Coal, leaving Pops with excess money but no heating. Pops start dying, and the player has to decide to wait until the price of Coal increases due to low supply such that their Steel Mills have failed so Pops get access to the supply, or close/destroy their Steel Mills temporarily until they can secure their Coal supply. Or, if Pops buy first, the Steel Mills get no Coal and close down, thereby causing Pops to lose their jobs so they can't afford to buy Coal, leading to a cycle of different agents in the system failing and/or downward spirals. Furthermore, with sequential purchasing that depends on the outcome of the previous purchase, we cannot multithread the logic. Hard priority buy sequences like this feel artificial and cause frustrations where players ideally want to control the distribution top-down with sliders, which of course is both fiddly and nonsensical from an immersion perspective.  </p>
<p>Option 2: Have an overall "trade manager" split supply proportionally between purchasers based on desired purchasing amount. This is the rational decision since it can both be multithreaded and doesn't lead to systemic cyclical breakdowns. However, when combined with a Goods Substitution feature, such a trade manager would have to balance two parameters (availability and price) across a number of different permutations to make a single rational purchase decision that maximizes the yield for potentially tens of thousands of agents. There may be some cool math that can be applied here but none that we can instrumentalize such that it can reliably execute several times per second.  </p>
<p>This is already a computationally difficult problem. Now insert local price conditions based on Infrastructure and Market Access. How much of the market's allotment of Coal compared to Oil should a Farmer in Michigan get to buy when Michigan only has 75% Market Access but Coal is produced locally?  </p>
<p>With an open economy where stockpiles are abstracted into the price conditions, we can have all purchases resolve on their own thread and tally up into a total combined price. If the price is too high for some of those purchasers to sustain it in the long run, their own economic conditions will deteriorate and demand will decrease. This means we can approach an equilibrium over time by each economic agent doing their thing, rather than trying to compute an optimal distribution between all agents given a multitude of variables that all influence each other.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORI DEV DIARY #10 TNFRASTRUCTURE</font></p>
<p>Hello again and happy Thursday! Today we’re going to follow up on last week’s dev diary about Markets, which touched on Infrastructure but did not explain how it works. Infrastructure is an important mechanic for the economic simulation of the game, simulating the cost of moving goods over land and creating the necessary, well, infrastructure to support wide-scale industrialization.  </p>
<p>So what is Infrastructure then? Infrastructure is represented by two distinct values that each State has: Infrastructure and Infrastructure Usage, which together determine its Market Access. So long as the Infrastructure in the State is greater than or equal to the Infrastructure Usage, everything is fine and the State maintains a Market Access of 100%, but if usage starts exceeding the available Infrastructure, Market Access will be reduced by an amount proportional to how much of the usage is not being serviced.   </p>
<p>For example, if a state has an Infrastructure of 45 with a usage of 90, its Market Access will only be 50%. Market Access and its effects is something we’ve already covered in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-9-national-markets.1484917/">previous development diary</a>, but to briefly go over it again, a low Market Access means that a State is unable to fully integrate its local market into the National Market, which can lead to adverse price conditions from local over-or undersupply of goods.  </p>
<p><em>Minsk has somewhat overextended their local Infrastructure, but with a large population and mostly staple production both their industries and consumers will probably be fine until the railway arrives</em>  </p>
<p>*<a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2310%20-%20Infrastructure/image3.png"><img alt="image3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2310%20-%20Infrastructure/image3.png" title="image3.png" /></a></p>

​This imbalance goes in both directions. If you have one bread basket state and one iron mining state, and they both have perfect Market Access, the price of iron and grain will be the same in both. If the iron mining state’s Market Access is reduced, the market’s price of iron goes up while the local price of iron in the mining state goes down. But in addition to this the iron mining state will be unable to source as much grain, raising the local price there but reducing its price somewhat across the rest of the market.  </p>
<p>If your consumption matches your local production, as is often the case in rural states where the production consists of staple goods your people require, this isn’t such a big problem! You could perhaps even build some simple Textile Mills and Livestock Ranches in the same underdeveloped state to provide cheap wool clothing if the local population is large enough to demand it in sufficient quantity. But if you’re looking to manufacture more complex goods (or use more demanding Production Methods) you need goods you might only be able to source from another state in your market, or which you can only import from a foreign nation. These goods in turn might be lucrative but only if there are buyers for them - buyers who can actually afford them. Your schemes to get rich off Luxury Clothes and Porcelain won’t work if you can’t reach all the far-flung wealthy Pops of your empire.  </p>
<p>The Infrastructure Usage of a State is determined by which types of Buildings exist in a State and which level they are. Generally, the more urban and specialized the building, the more Infrastructure it uses per level, so Chemical Industries (a heavy industry building) will use several times more Infrastructure than a Rye Farms building of the same level.  </p>
<p><em>Minsk’s urban buildings - the Furniture Manufacturies, Textile Mills, even the Government Administrations - account for 2/3rds of its Infrastructure usage despite employing the same number of people as the Logging Camps and Rye Farms. Subsistence Farms and Urban Centers do not use Infrastructure, the former because its production is nearly all for domestic use and the latter because the Infrastructure it provides cancel out the Infrastructure it requires.</em>   </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2310%20-%20Infrastructure/image2.png"><img alt="image2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2310%20-%20Infrastructure/image2.png" title="image2.png" /></a></p>

<p>Infrastructure is provided and modified by numerous sources. Just about all States in the game have at least a little bit of Infrastructure based on the technology level of the country that owns it and its state of incorporation (colonies have lower infrastructure than incorporated states, for example). However, over the course of the game, the most crucial aspect of your Infrastructure is the size of your Railway network. As we’ve previously mentioned, Railways is a Building that produces Transportation, an intangible good sold to Pops, but they are also your main source of Infrastructure.  </p>
<p>This means that if you want to industrialize a State, it isn’t enough to simply build those industries there and have the Pops available to work in them, you also need to ensure that said industries have enough infrastructure to support them. This of course has a variety of costs involved in that infrastructure-providing Railways need both Pops to work them and access to goods like Coal and Engines. There are alternatives that can be used in the short-term, such as using your Authority on a Road Maintenance decree to ensure the populace don’t allow the roads to fall into disrepair or become unsafe, but such options will never be sufficient in themselves for large-scale industrialization. Of course, Railways also grow more efficient over the course of the game with such inventions as Diesel trains and Electricity, requiring less levels of rail to support a certain number of Buildings.  </p>
<p><em>This early Railway has rapidly become one of Minsk’s best employers, at least for Pops with the qualifications to become Machinists. Unfortunately few people do, so the Infrastructure production is not currently as high as it might be if the railway was fully staffed. Ticket prices, however, are sky high.</em>   </p>

<p>Our intention for railways is that they must be able to find their way back to the market capital, or an exit port destined for the market capital, in order to be useful. In effect this means that any railway can only provide infrastructure up to the amount of infrastructure provided by the best adjacent railway that connects it to the market capital. If you want good access to the Sulfur Mines in Aginskoye for your Munition Plants in St. Petersburg, you best get started on that Trans-Siberian Railway sooner rather than later, because it will take a good long while to build.  </p>
<p>Geography, of course, also plays a significant role in other ways when it comes to Infrastructure, and this is represented in Victoria 3 through State Traits. State Traits are bonuses and/or maluses given to a particular State representing particular geographical features, climate and so on. State Traits have a variety of effects, but the most common ones are to either affect the production of a particular resource (for example, if a State contains high quality coal this may be represented through a State Trait that makes coal mines in the state more efficient) or, more significantly for the topic on hand, to provide or modify Infrastructure.  </p>
<p><em>The high-yield Russian Forests are of great benefit to the Logging Industry in Minsk, as long as there’s enough infrastructure available to ship the wood off to all the Russian factories and construction sites that demand it.</em>   </p>

<p>Before we finish up for today, I also just want to mention that Infrastructure does tie into a number of mechanics besides Market Access, such as military logistics and migration, and that Infrastructure is only meant to simulate the cost of transporting goods on land - where the sea is concerned, there are other systems at play… but all of those are topics for another day, so for now I bid farewell and encourage you all to tune back in next week as Mikael returns with another economy-related dev diary about Employment and Qualifications.</p>

<p>How expensive/difficult is it to have 100% market access in all states for most of the game. In Vic2 placing your factories in the same as inputs gave bonuses. In Vic3 this happens only with non-ideal market access, when factories can benefit from better local prices. Do you intend to incentivize such behavior in Vic3? Can an economy with not ideal infrastructure and factories close to raw material sources be more efficient than one with fully developed rail network and all factories in urban centers without regard to input location?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really depends on how heavily you want to industrialize compared to how much you want to spend on maintaining infrastructure. A better alternative to just having the same level of railroad everywhere could for sure be to create pockets of heavy infrastructure and industrialization with weaker rail lines to the countryside where a focus on rural buildings means you don't need as much logistical support.</p>

<p>It's not that I exactly don't want minor canals in the game, it's just that if we're to have them I don't want them to fill the exact same role as railroads.

<p>There is currently no such effect as we don't track exactly where individual units of goods go (see Market dev diary on that topic), though we could potentially apply some sort of a discount based on how much of a building's needed goods can be locally sourced. I'll give it some thought.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cICTORIA DEV DIARY #I1 EMPLOYMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS</font></p>
<p>Happy Thursday and welcome to another deep-dive into the guts of Victoria 3’s economic machinery. This week we will be talking about Pop Professions, specifically how and why Pops change Profession. While this is an automatic process, the mechanics of it is still crucial knowledge to keep in the back of your head when building your society. Perhaps you want to ensure the population in one of your states are able to take on Machinist jobs before embarking on a rapid industrialization project there, or perhaps you want to ensure you don’t accidentally enable too much social mobility in a country already prone to uprisings against their true and lawful King.  </p>
<p>First, a quick recap. In the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-1-pops.1476573/">Pops</a> dev diary we learned that all Pops have a Profession, which determines their social strata and influences a number of things like wages, political strength, and Interest Group affiliations. In the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-3-buildings.1478868/">Buildings</a> dev diary we learned that buildings need Pops of specific Professions to work there in order for them to produce their intended effects on the economy and society. Finally, in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-5-production-methods.1480760/">Production Methods</a> dev diary we learned that different Production Methods change the number of Profession positions available in a building. So how do Pops get assigned to these spots?  </p>
<p>Our approach here differs a bit from previous games. Victoria 1 and 2 has the concept of a “Pop Type”, a fundamental property of Pops in those games that defines most aspects of their existence - what function they perform in society, what goods they need to survive vs. what goods they desire, what ideologies they espouse, etcetera. Pops in Victoria 2 autonomously change into other types over time depending on their finances and the various needs and aspects of the country. Providing access to luxury goods in your country permits Pops to promote more easily. Generally speaking, higher-tier Pops will provide better bonuses for your country as different Pop Types perform different functions. By manufacturing or importing special goods and educating your population you would turn your simple, backwards Pops into advanced, progressive types in ideal ratios, which maximizes these bonuses to increase your competitive advantage.  </p>
<p><em>Pop Types from Victoria 2: Aristocrats, Artisans, Bureaucrats, Capitalists, Clergymen, Clerks, Craftsmen, Farmers, Laborers, Officers, Slaves, and Soldiers.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2311%20-%20Employment%20and%20Qualifications/poptypes-v2.png"><img alt="poptypes-v2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2311%20-%20Employment%20and%20Qualifications/poptypes-v2.png" title="poptypes-v2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>Victoria 3 Pops instead have Professions. These are in some ways similar to “Pop Type”, but the ideal ratios and economic functions of those Professions differ based on the building they’re employed in and the Production Methods activated. The fundamental difference between these two approaches become clear when considering the Bureaucrat Pop Type/Profession in Victoria 2 and 3. In both games, Bureaucrats increase a country’s administrative ability. But in Victoria 2 Pops promote into Bureaucrats independently in relation to the amount of administrative spending the player sets, while in Victoria 3 Pops will only become Bureaucrats if there are available Bureaucrat jobs in Government buildings, usually as a result of the player actively expanding Government Administrations.  </p>
<p><em>Professions in Victoria 3: Academics, Aristocrats, Bureaucrats, Capitalists, Clergymen (temporary icon; will be changed to be more universally applicable), Clerks, Engineers, Farmers, Laborers, Machinists, Officers, Peasants, Servicemen, Shopkeepers, and Slaves.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2311%20-%20Employment%20and%20Qualifications/professions-v3.png"><img alt="professions-v3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2311%20-%20Employment%20and%20Qualifications/professions-v3.png" title="professions-v3.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: 47</font></p>
<p>​The latter approach gives the player more control over where these job opportunities are created, and combined with Production Methods cause demographic shifts to have stronger, more localized effects that are easier to predict and understand. It’s also more flexible, permitting the same Profession to cause different effects in different Buildings given different Production Methods. So in Victoria 3 higher-paid Pops don’t by their very nature perform a more valuable societal function than lower-paid Pops - rather, each acts as a crucial part of a Production Method’s ‘recipe’. Each of these roles require the others to be effective - without enough Laborers to shovel coal the engines the Machinists maintain stay dormant, and without seamstresses to work the sewing machines the Shopkeepers don’t have any clothes to sell.  </p>
<p>Buildings adjust their wages over time in order to achieve full employment with minimal wage costs. As employment increases, so does the Throughput - the degree by which the building consumes input goods and produces output goods. By the laws of supply and demand, this makes a building less profitable per capita the closer to full employment it gets, so at first blush it might appear irrational for a building to pay more wages just to reduce their margins. But since a “building” does not represent a single factory but rather a whole industrial sector across a large area, and we assume the individual businesses in that sector compete with each other rather than engage in cartel behavior to extort consumers, this adjustment of wages to maximize employment makes sense. However, buildings won’t increase wages due to labor competition if this would cause them to go into deficit, so there’s little point to expanding industries beyond the point where they’re profitable.  </p>
<p>Employees are hired into available jobs from the pool of Pops that already exist in the state, but unless they’re unemployed these Pops will already have a job somewhere doing something else. Pops can be hired under two conditions: first, they must be offered a measurably higher wage than the wage they’re currently getting from their current employment. Second, unless they already work as the required Profession in another building, they must also meet the Qualifications of that Profession to change into it.  </p>
<p><em>These Steel Mills don’t pay as well as the Arms Industries, but they do seem to offer better terms than the Textile Mills and resource industries in the same state - with the notable exception of Fishing Wharves, who also need Machinists to service their trawlers.</em>  </p>

<p>​Wages are set by individual buildings in response to market conditions. A building that is losing money will decrease wages until it’s back in the black. A building that has open jobs it can’t seem to fill will raise wages until it either fills the necessary positions or runs out of excess profits. As a result, different buildings in the same state will compete for the available workforce. What this means in practice is that a large population with the necessary Qualifications to perform all the jobs being created in the state will keep wages depressed and profits high. Only when industries are large or advanced enough that they need to compete with each other for a limited pool of qualified workers are wages forced to rise. This rise in wages also comes with increased consumption, which increases demand for goods and services that some of the same buildings may profit from in the end.  </p>
<p>A Pop’s Qualifications measure how many of its workforce qualify for certain Professions, and updates monthly depending on how well their current properties match up to the expectations of the Profession in question. For example, at least a basic education level is required to become a Machinist while a much higher one is required to become an Engineer. Conversely, the ability to become an Aristocrat is less about education and more about social class and wealth. Buildings won’t hire Pops who don’t meet the Qualifications for the Profession in question.  </p>
<p><em>These 981 Machinists qualify to become Engineers at a rate of 4.08 per month. Their Literacy is nothing to write home about but they at least meet the cut-off of 20%, aren’t starving to death, and benefit substantially from already working in an adjacent field. All factors and numbers are work-in-progress.</em>  </p>

<p>​If some Paper Mills required more Engineers and this Pop was being considered, only the amount of qualified Engineers they’ve accumulated so far could be hired. Currently that is only 85 (not shown). If those 85 were all hired, this Pop would then end up with only 896 members left in the workforce of which 0 now qualify to become Engineers. Since all recently hired Engineers used to be Machinists, all 85 retain their Machinist Qualifications. Furthermore, if 512 members of this Pop qualified to be Farmers before the hire (52%), of the 85 of them who were newly promoted to Engineers, 44 of these new Engineers are also qualified to become Farmers.  </p>
<p><em>To be considered for a “job” as Aristocrat a Pop must have at least moderate Wealth, and the more Wealth they have the faster they will develop this potential. Unlike many other jobs Literacy is not a requirement for being accepted into the aristocracy, but an education does make it easier. Bureaucrats and Officers have an easier time becoming Aristocrats than other members of society, while Pops who suffer discrimination on account of their culture have a much harder time. Finally, if a Pop does not meet the minimum Wealth requirement, they actually devolve any prior potential for becoming Aristocrats. This means that down-and-out former nobles robbed of their land and forced to go unemployed or (perish the thought) become a wage laborer will - over time - lose their ability to return to their former social class. All factors and numbers are work-in-progress.</em>  </p>

If you had previously developed a lot of potential Bureaucrats in your country but ran into budgetary problems and had to shut down your schools, over time those Pops who have already developed the Qualifications to become Bureaucrats will die off and not be replaced by newly educated ones. If your Capitalists in a given state had been underpaying their local discriminated employees to the degree that nobody gained the Qualifications to take over for them, and then some of those Capitalists move away to operate a newly opened Iron Mine in the next state over, rather than promoting some of the local discriminated Laborers to the newly opened jobs they will simply leave the spots open (and the mines underproducing) until some qualified Capitalists move in from elsewhere to take over.  </p>
<p>Qualifications are entirely moddable by simply providing the computational factors that should go into determining how the value develops each month. If you want to make a mod to split up the Clergymen Profession into individual variants for each Religion in the game, you could make the Imam Profession dependent on the Pop being Sunni or Shi’ite. If you wanted Aristocrat Qualification development to be highly dependent on the amount of unproductive Arable Land in the state the Pop lives in, you could do that. An event option or Decision that makes it faster and easier to educate Engineers but harder to educate Officers for the next 10 years? Absolutely.  </p>
<p><em>A breakdown of all Pops in Lower Egypt that qualify to become Engineers. Of course, any openings will be offered to existing Engineers first, and not all of the remaining qualified Pops would actually be interested in the job - though if it was lucrative enough, perhaps some Aristocrats on a failing Subsistence Farm would consider a career change.</em>  </p>

<p>​The intent of Qualifications is to signal to a player what capacity for employment they have available among any subset of their population. They cannot, for example, conquer a state filled with under-educated people they also legally discriminate against and expect to immediately build up a cutting-edge manufacturing- and trade center there. These efforts will be throttled by their inability to employ the locals into highly qualified positions, meaning they have to wait for members of their already qualified workforce to migrate there from the old country to take on any high-status positions created for them. But by building out their education system, paying Bureaucracy to extend their administrative reach to the new state through incorporation, and changing their Laws to extend citizenship to these new residents, they can start to build this capacity also in the locals.  </p>
<p>In summary, Qualifications is the mechanism by which access to education and your stance on discrimination - in addition to many other factors - impact your ability to expand different parts of your society. It is also the mechanism that sorts Pops logically into the economic (and thereby political) niches you carve out as you expand, ensuring your laws and economic conditions inform the social mobility of Pops based on who they are. It’s quite subtle, and you might not even notice it’s there - until you run into the challenges caused by rapid industrialization, mass migration, conquests, colonization, and other drastic population shifts.  </p>
<p>That is all for this week! Next Thursday we will finally get into how all this economic activity translates into revenue streams for you, when Martin presents the mechanics governing the Treasury and national debt.</p>

<p>Unemployment occurs in instances where some employees leaves and proportionality cannot be easily restored (i.e. a couple of smaller businesses in the sector closed down because a bunch of Engineers went elsewhere, rendering the Machinists, Laborers, and Capitalists temporarily inconvenienced for a few weeks until they can find other employment), when there's inbound migration but insufficient jobs (and/or insufficient Qualifications among the immigrants), and when automation Production Methods are activated that makes a chunk of workforce redundant.</p>

<p>The Pop icons in V2 were great for this, agreed. The reasons we didn't use this approach in V3 are threefold:  </p>
<p>1) Static icons that look like people could not possibly even <em>begin</em> to represent the diversity of people all around the world. I find V2's icons to be immersive when I play Britain, but pretty immersion-shattering when I play Bhutan.  </p>
<p>2) On the other hand we don't want different icons for different cultures, either, since the point of an "icon" is to be instantly recognizable even between different game sessions.  </p>
<p>3) We have the technological luxury of actually being able to display each Pop as a rendered portrait of a unique person, which reduces the need to use Profession icons to give you a sense of Pop personhood by approximately 97%.</p>

<p>This will make the building extremely unprofitable which will cause it to dump its wages. This will cause the lowest-paid employees to return to being Peasants on Subsistence Farms or just migrate away. It can also cause unemployment if a bunch of Laborers leave, nobody else comes in to replace them on account of the low wages offered, and Pops of other Professions are fired to restore proportionality.</p>

<p>The size is static by building type but depends on the building level, so a level 3 Textile Mill has 3x the size Cash Reserve of a level 1 Textile Mill. It does not disappear under command economies, no.</p>

<p>You're correct that some of the fundamental distinctions between capitalist and communist systems of organizing the economy cannot be captured with our market mechanics, since it's completely driven by supply and demand affecting goods prices in ways that doesn't make a clear distinction between "sales price" and "value" .</p>

<p>Yes! The literacy rate shown is actually a computation, the value stored in the Pop is how many of its members are literate.

<p>So if I understand this correctly, let's have a look at this example:  </p>
<p>There are two job opportunities in a state, both competing for the same workers. Let's say, they each want 100 and there are 100 in total in the state. One is slightly more profitable than the other. Over time, if nothing else changes, we will see an equilibrium in which the more profitable workplace ("1") is filled to 100% (taking in all available workers) and the other ("2") has 0?  </p>
<p>Now what happened is that 1 increased its wages to compete against 2 and because 1 is more profitable, it could do so longer than 2, winning the race. However, 1 still diminished its profitability because of the high wages. My question is: Will the now empty 2 keep pushing up wages for 1, until it is demolished?  </p>
<p>Or do I have an error in my example and, e.g. the split between 1 and 2 is more continuous, like 80%/20%, depending on the profitability-advantage, because it is reduced when having higher employment rate?  </p>
<p>And in any case, we effectively see a distribution of wealth to the limiting factor of production (in this case: labor)? If there were more wokers than jobs, we'd see the profiuts go to the jop opportunity owners? If so, are the owners' wages paid before the job opportunity balance is made or will they effectively work for free to fill their jobs (given that "being in black" is the hard cut-off)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a limit to how many Pops can be hired by a building each week. In week 1, workplace 1 will gain hiring precedence and will recruit the "best" workers until it's reached its limit. If there are more qualifying workers after that, workplace 2 will recruit them, up to their limit. If the building manages to hire it won't increase wages. Now, in week 2, workplace 1 has now increased their throughput and their net profit as a result has decreased somewhat, and it won't try to increase wages since it's been successful in recruiting new workers. This makes it comparatively less desirable than workplace 2, which might have increased its wages and as such might get precedence over 1 this time around.  </p>
<p>Over time, the most productive / profitable building will be able to hire more workers than the less productive building, but they'll both get opportunities to increase their throughput and for as long as they have profit to spare and job opportunities to fill they will continue to compete on wages to steal workers from each other.  </p>
<p>As for owner wages, they're distinct from dividends - these are the excess profits paid out to shareholders (=owners) after Cash Reserve deposits have been made. So owners take their "fixed" share of the wages alongside everyone else in the building, but then get paid a weekly bonus depending on how well the building is doing.</p>

<p>At the moment there is no explicit "there are job opportunities over there, time to move" mechanic, since that would require us to assess the <em>wage</em> paid for each of those job opportunities compared to the current wage the Pop is being offered to not get weird effects. Essentially to model it perfectly would be to assess each opportunity for each Pop <em>across a whole market</em> which would be much too CPU heavy and arguably quite unrealistic given that there are huge economic and social barriers to packing up and moving even to an adjacent state in the same country.  </p>
<p>However, the Standard of Living (which we'll learn more about in a couple of weeks) of Pops in a state does affect its migration attraction. Indirectly this means that if a state has a good amount of labor competition and therefore relatively high wages, <em>and</em> reasonable access to consumer goods and government amenities that affect that measure, it will be a better state to move to. In addition, unemployed Pops are more likely than employed Pops to take the risk of moving to another state in search of greener pastures. This does create the effect you're describing, it just takes a longer route to get there.</p>

<p>How is this "fair" wage calculated? It seems like it has to be enough to potentially pull qualified workers from high-profit industries. But you don't want two subsidised industries to get into a bidding war for labour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All countries keep track of a constantly updating "Normal Wage Rate" that's based on the average wage rate across all non-government, non-subsistence buildings in their incorporated territory. This wage rate is used to determine the fair wage rate for employees of subsidized buildings, as well as set the baseline for what government employees should be paid. So the higher the average private-sector wage across your country (at least the incorporated parts) the higher the cost of paying government employees and subsidizing buildings will be.</p>

<p>I am unsure whether I understood this idea that increased production decreases (marginal) profits. Is this solely due to the fact that increased supply in a market with constant demand decreases the product price? If so, the production change we talk about here would have to be significant compared to the market size.  </p>
<p>And on the other hand, increased production should increase the total profit of the business, as each produced unit still has a specific profit. The marginal profit is then not really an issue. If I can double my throughput and the marginal profit goes down by 10%, that seems like a damn good deal: I will make more money. Why would this mean I have to lower wages?  </p>
<p>On top, even if the added unit has negative variable profit, it could still cover some fixed costs, increasing overall profitability. Or are there no fixed costs?  </p>
<p>So in conclusion: why does increased production reduces the profit and thus the wages for all workers? Seems also like something the Betriebsrat would take offense in Smile    :).  </p>
<p>Or is it more abstract, representing a balance of wages workers are going to accept in the long term and not so much a company's production planning rational? In this case, I may be able to understand it, as you need both upwards and downwards pressure on wages from somewhere to create dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the part you're overlooking is that a doubled Throughput resulting from a doubling of total employees will also require double the wages? As an example, let's say I employ 5000 employees and make 2000 in profit, due to my wages costing me 1000, input goods cost being 4000, and sale of output goods yielding 7000. Under these conditions, if I doubled my employment and thereby my Throughput and we assumed zero or negligible change in goods prices due to supply and demand (no loss of marginal profit) then my now 10,000 employees will generate 4000 in profit due to wage expenses of 2000, input goods expenses of 8000, and sale of output goods yielding 14,000. Yes, this is a higher absolute profit but since the number of shareholders (owner) have also doubled, wages + dividends paid out per employee will remain the same.  </p>
<p>This means that any decrease in marginal profit, whether 1% or 50%, as a result of proportionally increasing employment will always result in less net profits generated per employee. This would be different if a building had fixed costs no matter its size (they do not) and is to some degree counteracted by a small Economy of Scale bonus that some buildings have, where Throughput gains a small boost in larger buildings independent of workforce size, but the core principle remains.</p>

<p>I am afraid you are implying ownership is not present in the game and it is only a title without any effect. If "owners" double every time the employees double, this means "owners" are only employees. Ownership should come from selling shares of companies to investors. [..]This is a way to achieve accumulation of capital, and one of the main reasons for capitalism to thrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than "owners" we speak of Shareholders in Victoria 3. Any Pops in a building can also be Shareholders in that building, the amount per Pop typically determined by its Ownership Production Method. Dividends are split between Pops in relation to the number of Shares they hold and the building's Cash Reserve is also considered to be owned - albeit in an illiquid manner - by the Shareholders in proportion to their shares. This lets us represent many different forms of ownership types, investments, etc.  </p>
<p>What is does <em>not</em> let us do is represent unlimited, snowballing accumulation of capital in individuals, as you point out, particularly across several industrial sectors. In its current form, shares in a building can only be owned by Pops in the building's workforce, including Capitalists, Aristocrats, etcetera. This implies that e.g. Capitalists actually do some meaningful work in running the day-to-day operations of a business and therefore cannot simply let their workforce balloon without also creating more opportunities for Capitalists to manage the growing operation in the process. This is not completely representative of reality and is a bit of an idealized take on how market economies operate in practice, but there are several gameplay benefits to using this model and its representation as the default behavior. Snowballing accumulation of capital can still be modelled by reducing the number of available Capitalists job opportunities in a building under certain conditions, and it's not out of the question that something like that will make it in. But I can't say I'm feeling the lack of this in-game right now, Capitalists tend to get plenty powerful in industrializing nations even without the ability to snowball their capital.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a very good consideration, but it's not as sensitive as one might think at first blush! There are a lot of cultures in the game, so adding a few more isn't going to make much of an impact. Religion might be the most sensitive one, particularly world-spanning religions, but you'd have to double the number of religions to theoretically double the number of Pops, which is still fine. Another Profession won't matter if the new type replaces an existing Profession in a building (for example, let's say a new Artists Profession replace Academics in a certain building) since no more Pops are created than before. Similarly, if new Professions are made for Clergymen of different religions, unless you have Priests and Imams in the same building no additional Pops would be created. To really start to flirt with poor performance you'd have to make a mod that doubles the <em>number of different Professions in each building type</em>, or create so many new and <em>necessary</em> building types that the average number of buildings per state doubles, and even then you'd likely only run into trouble by endgame.  </p>
<p>Any of the above scenarios pale in comparison to the situation where most of the world abandons discrimination policies and Pops start moving around a lot, which can happen in a vanilla game and is the worst-case scenario we need to benchmark for. Please don't quote me out of context on that. Stick Out Tongue    :p</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #12 (REASURY</font></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to another development diary for Victoria 3! Today we’ll be covering a topic that tends to be very much in the mind of governments of all eras: Money! Specifically, we’re going to be talking about income, expenses and debt, and how they function on the national level.  </p>
<p>As was mentioned all the way back in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-2-capacities.1477662/">Dev Diary #2</a>, Money is one of the principal resources you have to manage in Victoria 3. This in itself is of course nothing new (money of some form playing a role in almost every Grand Strategy game we’ve ever released), but the way money works is a little bit different than what you might be used to.  </p>
<p>In most games, money tends to be a resource you accumulate for a specific goal, until you have enough of it to achieve that specific goal. For example, you might want to build a building that costs 100 money, and your monthly income is 10 money. That means in order to build said building, you have to wait for 10 months to accumulate the 100 money needed for the lump sum cost to order the construction of said building.   </p>
<p>Now, you might be asking, why am I explaining such a simple and obvious mechanic that undoubtedly every single reader of this dev diary is completely familiar with? The reason for this is because in Victoria 3, there is no such thing as a lump sum cost - instead, it’s all about your weekly balance. At the end of every in-game week, your country’s income and expenses are tallied up and the result is then applied to your Gold Reserve or National Debt. This also means that all forms of expenses, such as construction, also work on a weekly basis - you do not need any cash ‘on hand’ to start construction of a dozen buildings at once, but if you don’t have the revenue to support it you may find yourself quickly going into debt.  </p>

<p>​The Gold Reserve is your country’s national stockpile of cash. If you are free of debt, any money that is left over in the weekly budget after expenses are subtracted is used to increase the Gold Reserve. Conversely, if your expenses exceed your income, this money is taken out of the Gold Reserve to balance the books.   </p>
<p>Though it’s certainly never bad in itself to have a sizable Gold Reserve, it isn’t necessarily the best idea to continually run a large budget surplus - each country has a Gold Reserve Limit, which is a ‘soft-cap’ over which each surplus pound has diminishing returns on the Gold Reserve - if you have an enormous stockpile of gold, a surplus of £10k may only increase your stockpile by as little as £2k, meaning that you’ve simply wasted the rest of your money. Hence, a country that finds its gold reserves filling up may want to consider finding a way to reinvest some of that money to avoid such wastage.  </p>
<p><em>The Spanish Gold Reserve has grown to the point where further stockpiling is becoming very inefficient, and they should really try to find better uses for some of that money</em>  </p>

<p>​So what if you’re running a deficit and your Gold Reserve has all been tapped? Well, this is when debt comes into play. Beyond that point, each pound spent in excess of your income will result in automatically taking on debt. While this may sound like something that you should avoid at all costs, that isn’t necessarily true.   </p>
<p>While you do have to pay interest on your loans, interest rates in Victoria 3 are relatively low, and so long as you avoid hitting your Debt Ceiling, growing your economy through deficit spending can actually be a very valid strategy. This is because the increase in revenues from minting and taxation may very well end up exceeding the interest payments, not to mention the benefits constructing new industries can have for your population.  </p>
<p>The Debt Ceiling, unlike the Gold Reserve, is not a soft cap - once you hit it, your country will be in default, which is a terrible state to be in and can only be recovered from if you manage to slash your expenses enough to put your weekly expenses back in the black (or if another country steps in and takes on your debt, which can have its own undesirable outcomes for you… but more on that later). It’s also possible to simply declare bankruptcy, but because the money you are borrowing against is actually the cash reserves of your country’s buildings (which is actually what determines the size of your Debt Ceiling), this will have immensely negative consequences for your domestic industry.  </p>
<p><em>Even though Britain has taken on several million pounds of debt, this isn’t too much of an issue - their advanced economy allows them a high debt ceiling, and the interest payments is only a small fraction of their spending</em>​*<a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2312%20-%20Treasury/dd12_3.png"><img alt="dd12_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2312%20-%20Treasury/dd12_3.png" title="dd12_3.png" /></a></p>

<p>To wrap up this Dev Diary, I’m going to briefly touch on the main forms of income and expenditures, though this is by no means an exhaustive list! Some forms of income and expenses (taxes and salaries, specifically) also have a ‘level’ setting, where you can for example squeeze more taxes out of your population at the cost of reduced legitimacy and increased radicalization.  </p>

<p>Main Types of Income (not an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minting</strong>: All countries can generate some cash flow by printing or casting new currency in relation to their GDP. Minting provides all countries with some income - particularly those who have domestic Gold Fields - but is in itself insufficient for funding anything but the most minimalist of governments.</li>
<li><strong>Income Taxes</strong>: A form of taxation collected on income, where a certain % of the wages paid to workers in buildings is paid to the government.</li>
<li><strong>Poll Taxes</strong>: A form of per-capita taxation where a fixed sum of money is collected on each member of the workforce. Poll Taxes are very regressive since they collect the same amount regardless of income.</li>
<li><strong>Land Taxes</strong>: A special type of Poll Taxes that are only collected on certain types of Pops, such as Peasants.</li>
<li><strong>Consumption Taxes</strong>: A tax that is levied directly on a specific good that is consumed by Pops. Levying Consumption Taxes costs Authority.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Taxes</strong>: A tax that is applied to dividends paid to Pops with an ownership stake in a Building. Tends to be a very progressive form of taxation, as usually only well-to-do Pops have ownership of buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs</strong>: Tariffs are something that we plan to have in the game as a way to profit from goods being exported from your market, but we’re not ready to talk about exactly how this will work yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main Types of Expenses (not an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Wages</strong>: The salary cost of employing Pops in your Government Buildings such as Government Administrations and Ports.</li>
<li><strong>Government Goods</strong>: The material costs for your Government Buildings, for example the Paper needed by Government Administrations.</li>
<li><strong>Military Wages:</strong> The salary costs of Pops serving in your army and navy.</li>
<li><strong>Military Goods</strong>: The various goods needed by your army and navy, such as Small Arms for Barracks.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidies</strong>: The cost of subsidizing specific buildings to ensure they remain competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Interest</strong>: The cost of making interest payments on your loans, if you have any.</li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong>: The cost of constructing new buildings, both in goods required for the method of construction and wages paid to Pops working in the construction industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well then, that’s all for today. Next week we’re going to be talking about a topic that touches on both economics and politics - Standard of Living. See you then!</p>

<p>An idea that was floated upthread is to treat the amount of the credit limit/debt ceiling a country is using as a measure of the market's trust in them - if you have modest debts, such as England in the DD, people are more confident you'll repay them than if you're running very close to the red line. So modest deficit spending might have its supporters among your pops but if it spirals out of control, they'll be steadily more worried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our first debt model during early prototyping did actually use escalating interest rates the closer to the debt ceiling you got, for exactly these reasons. In practice, since compounding interest <em>and</em> escalating interest <em>rate</em> becomes exponential, that made for terrible, unfun death spirals where if your investments didn't all pan out perfectly all you could do was sit and wait for bankruptcy. It discouraged players from deficit spending, which was the exact opposite we wanted from our loans system. So nice idea, but didn't work.</p>

<p>Any Gold Fields the country controls adds a fixed amount of money to the Minting revenue stream.  </p>
<p>Several of the tax categories are controlled by Laws which the player can change or abolish, thus creating or destroying revenue streams.</p>

<p>IMO, there is no real need for the treasury ceiling since a country hoarding its money is not necessarily a good thing for the economy and should impact the economy negatively just by its mere act. I wish the whole lending thing could have been handled more realistically by using banks, gilt edged securities, credit ratings and fluctuating interest rates to deter high levels of borrowing rather than just an artificial cap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right! There's no actual, rational need for a soft cap to hoarding, because those funds are extracted from your economy in various ways and are completely unproductive while in the Treasury. Outside of saving for a rainy day (by which I mean, probably war) there's no compelling reason to let money pile up in your treasury.  </p>
<p>But this does not account for lizard brain psychology. Most strategy gamers - myself certainly included - have been trained to believe "big green number good" and "red debt very bad" and the soft-cap counteracts that by gently nudging the player to put the money back in circulation if their pile of gold gets way too big compared to their GDP. Sure, we could have made the Pops get mad if the government's hoarding their hard-earned tax contributions instead, but we didn't want to hurt the player for doing well. Instead we just apply some diminishing returns to encourage upping your spending.  </p>
<p>The debt ceiling / credit limit on the other hand is a hard cap, and I'd argue this is not particularly unrealistic - because once the debt reaches this point, every last pence in the private national money reserves has been borrowed against by the national government. This is money that has been actually earned by your industries, not arbitrary parameters selected for optimal game balance. I fully stand by that it's a reasonable component of a game simulation - at least in this era - to not let a government to be able to borrow more from its economy than its total net worth via normal financial instruments.</p>

<p>As for the interest , is it simple interest or compound interest?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interest rate listed is annual but levied weekly along with all other expenses. So if you have a 10% annual interest on the principal, this is split up into 52 payment chunks of about 0.2% on all outstanding debt per week. As a result, if you keep running a deficit your actual interest paid over 1 year will be higher than 10% as your interest hasn't been paid but instead compounded onto your principal.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cICTORIA DEV DIARY #13 STANDARD OF LIVING</font></p>
<p>Hello again and welcome to yet another walkthrough of some interrelated systems fundamental to Victoria 3’s economic model: Standard of Living, Wealth, Pop Needs, and Consumption.  </p>
<p>All <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-1-pops.1476573/">Pops</a> in Victoria 3 have a Standard of Living score between 1 and 99, which represents - by a <em>perfectly scientific and objective metric</em>, don’t @ me - precisely how great their life is. Pops with levels 1-4 are labeled Starving, levels 5-9 are Struggling, and so on through Impoverished, Middling, Secure, Prosperous, Affluent, Wealthy, Lavish, and at levels 60+, Opulent. We don’t really expect a lot of Pops to reach levels 60+ but - knowing you folks - we’ve left plenty of headroom to accommodate your mad economic experiments.  </p>
<p>Standard of Living affects two major aspects of the game: birth- and death rate, and Pop loyalty.  </p>
<p>Birth rate is simply the percentage of children born to Pops each year, while death rate is the percentage of Pops who die. Both values start out high and decline with increasing Standard of Living, but birth rate declines slower than death rate, leading to a net increase in population growth with increasing Standard of Living. This system models that increasing Standard of Living tends to lead to longer life expectancy but declining natality. Each parameter can be modified independently by a variety of effects.  </p>
<p><em>Scratch your priesthood’s back and they’ll scratch yours. Note that Interest Group Traits can vary between Interest Group variants, so a different religion might provide a different benefit.</em>  </p>

Go to Details screen</font></p>
<p>​Pop loyalty is altered whenever their Standard of Living increases or declines from its current value. Martin will get into much more detail on this in next week’s Development Diary on Political Movements.  </p>
<p>A Pop’s Wealth attribute forms the foundation for its Standard of Living. Pops can also gain more intangible boosts or penalties to their Standard of Living from any number of sources.  </p>
<p>Pops accumulate Wealth over time while their weekly income exceeds their weekly expenses. Conversely, if a Pop’s expenses exceed its income, Wealth will decline. How large their expenses are depends on what and how much they consume, which is also dependent on their Wealth. What this means is that as long as a Pop’s income remains the same, and the cost of the goods and services in their state and market remains the same, that Pop’s Wealth will over time drift towards exactly the level of consumption they can afford to sustain. Of course, as Wealth changes the consumption also changes, which affects the prices of the goods in the market, which might in turn affect their wages, dividends, etcetera.  </p>
<p><em>This weekly shortfall of funds will eventually lead to a reduction in Wealth and thereby consumption, but since the shortfall is only a small fraction of its income it will take several months to have an impact on the Wealth score and thereby the Standard of Living.</em>  </p>

<p>​Wealth has a number of functions in addition to forming the basis for Standard of Living.

Some privately operated <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-8-institutions.1484231/">Institutions</a> provide benefits to Pops only in relation to their Wealth. Many Professional <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-11-employment-and-qualifications.1487723/">Qualifications</a> also require Pops to have a certain amount of Wealth.  </p>
<p>Each Wealth level is defined by a set of Needs and an amount of “value” that needs to be spent on <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-4-goods.1479730/">goods</a> to fulfill that Need. This “value” is defined in goods base prices, such that the Need for Standard Clothing for a Pop of size 10,000 with Wealth level 14 might be fulfilled by buying £87 worth of Clothes, assuming perfectly balanced supply and demand. If the actual price of Clothes where the Pop lives is over-demanded, their cost to fulfill this need will also be higher. As a result, cheaper goods means wealthier, happier Pops.  </p>
<p><em>This Peasant Pop’s Wealth is low (6), so it consumes only the basic necessities.</em>  </p>

<p>​Many Needs can be satisfied by a variety of different goods. For example, the Need for Heating requires Wood, Fabric, Coal, Oil, and/or Electricity. These can be purchased in any combination assuming the total base prices add up to the required value. When given this option Pops will attempt to make a rational purchase decision based on which goods are the most available, satisfying their Need with some mix of these goods or even only one, if that’s the only one available. In this way an inland, isolated state might not consume any Fish at all as long as it has sufficient Grain, Fruit, Meat, or even packaged Groceries to satisfy their Need for food.  </p>

<p>​Goods can also appear in several different Needs categories. Groceries, Meat, and Fruit can fulfil the need for both Basic Food and Luxury Food, but Grain or Fish can only fulfil the need for Basic Food. As a result, maintaining only Millet Farms and Fishing Wharfs to meet your food needs will mostly satisfy your poor Pops, while focusing on Livestock Ranches and Banana Plantations will cause wealthy Pops to inflate the price of the available food supply and further impoverish the poor. Operating productive Food Industries that can turn Grain and Fish into Groceries is good for everyone in your country, and frees up any available supply of Meat and Fruit to be consumed by those with a Need for Luxury Food.  </p>

<p>​Lower Wealth levels have only a handful of Needs, such as Simple Clothing, Heating, Basic Food, and Intoxicants. The middle levels introduce more refined Needs like Household Items, Services, Luxury Drinks, and Free Movement. Really wealthy Pops consume increasingly vast quantities of Luxury Goods to impress and outdo their peers. In some cases Needs disappear entirely in favor of more diverse Needs. The Need for Simple Clothing which can be satisfied by both Fabric and Clothes will, as a Pop is raised from abject poverty, be gradually phased out by the Need for Standard Clothing which include only professionally sewn items.  </p>
<p><em>Compared to the Wealth 6 Peasants, these Wealth 17 Bureaucrats are more diverse in their requirements.</em>  </p>

<p>​Introducing new goods into your market will help you diversify your economy and alleviate the demand on crucial industrial goods. Importing Oil - either petroleum from newly discovered deposits or whale oil from the few places in the world that produce it - will cause your Pops to buy some quantity of it for heating instead of Coal or Electricity, which lowers the price of those goods and help make your industries more profitable. Introducing Opium into your market will decrease Pop demand for Liquor and Tobacco... for good or ill.  </p>
<p>Some goods are favored over others by default if available. Once Electricity is available to them, due to its convenience Pops will prefer to buy it over Wood or Coal, even if they’re the same price. Some goods can be replaced by other goods entirely, while others will always be required to some bare minimum. Train travel can completely replace the need for having your own Automobile to drive around in, but having an Automobile doesn’t ever completely remove the need for an occasional train ride to see your cousin who lives all the way in Paris.  </p>
<p>In addition to these factors cultures can develop Obsessions for certain goods, and some even have Taboos they must abide by. A country can also encourage or discourage the consumption of certain goods using Authority, perhaps in an effort to avoid enriching a hated enemy or entice Pops to buy something that’s heavily taxed over something that is not. This impacts the purchase habits of Pops affected despite this being irrational from a strictly financial perspective.  </p>
<p><em>What if the Bengali were obsessed with the status afforded to them by Luxury Furniture? This could happen due to events, or organically because Luxury Furniture is a really prevalent luxury good in markets where a lot of Bengali Pops live. But even if this habit is developed around their homelands, Bengali Pops that migrate abroad - to the USA or Australia or Japan - will continue preferring Luxury Furniture to other luxury goods, and will suffer financially if the same level of access is not available there.</em>  </p>

<p>​Let’s close out by considering the difference between this and the consumption model from previous games. In Victoria 2, Pops have different Life, Everyday, and Luxury Needs based on their Type (what we call Profession in Victoria 3), both in types of goods and quantities. Pops in Victoria 2 always strive to get promoted into Types which require more advanced, luxurious goods in larger quantities, but will fail to do so if they cannot afford it. Since certain advanced Types of Pops in Victoria 2 perform their duties objectively better than their less advanced counterparts (e.g. Craftsmen, Clerks) it becomes important to retain access to advanced goods in order to ensure that your workforce is internationally competitive.  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3 this formula is turned on its head. An Engineer is not intrinsically better than a Machinist who is not intrinsically better than a Laborer, and there’s no ideal national proportions between them you need to maintain in order to maximize your competitiveness. Different Professions do fulfil different functions, but it’s the Production Methods of the Buildings they work in that determine what function they serve. By choosing what Buildings to construct and which Production Methods to activate, you create the opportunities for these Professions which in turn impose changes to the population. What types of goods you need to ensure access to in order to keep your population satisfied is not driven directly by what professional opportunities you have created, but rather by what Wealth development and Wealth distribution these changes have resulted in.  </p>
<p><em>Professions that are part of the Middle Strata in this state are considerably better off than those in the Lower Strata, and not far off from the Upper Strata. It’s very likely this state hasn’t started industrializing yet, since Shopkeepers - who run the pre-industrial economy - are Middle Strata, and Upper Strata Aristocrats aren’t always particularly wealthy if their income originates from exploiting the Peasantry on Subsistence Farms. Since the Middle Strata is already wealthy enough to demand Transportation, construction of Railways in this state is likely to be both profitable and beneficial for population growth and general happiness.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2313%20-%20Standard%20of%20Living/sol-breakdown.PNG"><img alt="sol-breakdown.PNG" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2313%20-%20Standard%20of%20Living/sol-breakdown.PNG" title="sol-breakdown.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>​As a result, Pops in Victoria 3 won’t always strive to ascend to a higher social strata, nor will an Aristocrat always have a higher income or goods consumption Needs compared to a Clerk. All of this is driven by market forces - a qualifying Clerk would gladly become an Aristocrat on available land <em>if that comes with a higher income</em> than remaining a Clerk, and this increased income will gradually result in an increase in their Wealth and consumption demand. Conversely, Aristocrats don’t demote to Laborers because they can't acquire enough goods to sustain their lifestyle - they would only turn to such desperate measures if they become landless (unemployed) and are trying to avoid starvation, or if by some miracle taking on a relatively well-paid Laborer job in a particularly profitable factory would actually yield a greater paycheck than their failing farm provides them with.  </p>
<p>In practice this means that it's important in both games to secure your populations’ basic needs to prevent starvation and dissent, followed by appeasing their desire for ever more advanced or exotic goods in larger and larger quantities to increase the size of your economy and power on the world stage. But while reaching this commonly pursued end goal in Victoria 2 often meant pursuing a certain optimal population distribution no matter what else happened throughout the game, the Professions of the Pops you end up with could be vastly different between games in Victoria 3! If you build a colonial plantation economy, your Aristocrats might remain as dominant by endgame as they were at start. If you're a manufacturing powerhouse on the cutting edge of technological progress, your middle strata Pops might come to rival the Capitalist class in wealth and power. If your high taxes are reinvested in vast Institutions your power base might be dominated by Bureaucrats and Academics. If your workers own the means of production, your Laborers might even be wealthier - and consume more luxuries - than your neighbor's Aristocrats.  </p>
<p>These possibilities for diverse Pop distributions also result in very different political tendencies in your population, which lead to demand for different kinds of Laws. While in Victoria 2 it’s primarily the rising Consciousness of a greater ratio of more advanced and literate types of Pops that drives a desire for reform in a liberal direction, Victoria 3’s more open-ended consumption model and the diversity of Professions it can create could result in your population having very different political desires by endgame depending on the path you’ve taken. This requires your political machinery to be working in tandem with your economic engine, both to create the right conditions for your Pops and to satisfy their changing desires.  </p>
<p>Next week, we will learn more about these desires as Martin introduces us to Political Movements, which themselves are strongly connected to Standard of Living. Until then!</p>

<p>Other than time and resources, I don't think there are any technical limitations anymore! It used to be the case that our tooltip system only supported formatted text (the graphics you see in there are actually icons converted into text to embed it inline), but full layout in templated tooltips is now a possibility in the engine. But creating text-only tooltips is still about 10x faster, so particularly during this stage in development when things are still a bit fluid it's not top of the list.  </p>
<p>All this feedback is appreciated and will be taken into consideration for the final product, though!</p>

<p>I really hope we get a ledger for Victoria 3, as the massive amount of information that we are shown to have access to in these dev diaries scream be organized in some form of easily accessible overview. I don't want to have to click on provinces frantically trying to find out which is in the worst economic state, or which one is producing the most oil, which enemy state province would be the most valuable to grab, etc. I want pie charts, graphs, plots!! Please bring them back in some form!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our approach here is to actually try to figure out what information is relevant to a player in which contexts and provide that, rather than a ledger filled with raw numbers. The latter would be much easier (text-based infodumps are dead simple) but  </p>
<p>a) it's overwhelming to a player who doesn't already understand how everything in the game works, which works against our philosophy on accessibility  </p>
<p>b) as soon as we start to make information available in a ledger format we reduce the pressure on ourselves to make it available in a more useful context  </p>
<p>So we do have pie charts, graphs, and plots, but we show them alongside the items they pertain to, not in a separate information system. You should absolutely not have to click through a bunch of states to figure out what's going on with them - we have summaries for that in a number of places, often using the map and sortable lists to visualize that kind of information.  </p>
<p>That's certainly not to rule out the idea of a raw infodump function in the future! We can't intelligently pre-parse all information for all use cases and besides, a lot of the data is just really fun to ~~drown in~~ absorb. But it's not our go-to solution for solving the kinds of use cases you're describing, since we have a lot of other methods at our disposal to expose that kind of data.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly doable already to some degree through UI modding! But the takeaway here is that we're not in any way anti-ledger, we're just against putting something like that in as a primary solution to the kinds of gameplay problems listed (like "where can I find oil" or "which of my states are costing me the most money") since that would relieve us from the responsibility of connecting the actionable information with the actions. There's an utterly ridiculous amount of raw data in the game already and where we think it makes sense and/or is just plain fun to gather and summarize it, we absolutely will!</p>

<p>Yes exactly, but since Fabric and Coal might have different base prices per unit, this can work out to different numbers of units for different goods required to satisfy a particular Need. This idea that a Need is not a certain number of units of goods but a certain amount of objective "value" you are satisfying by acquiring goods that sum up to that value is crucial to the inner workings of the goods substitution system.</p>

<p>I wonder how new technologies (e.g. telephones and radios) fit into the needs.

Is there any Red Queen Race, where more access to goods also simply mean that more consumption is needed to keep up with the Joneses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the moment they are substitutable goods within existing Needs categories, that either have a "convenience" bias that cause Pops to favor them if available or are intrinsically more effective to manufacture, causing them to become available in greater quantities which leads to greater relative consumption. For example, Telephones can substitute for Free Movement to some degree but cannot completely displace the Need for physical travel, and Radios are Luxury Items.  </p>
<p>Introducing new, dynamic "Needs" that ups the bar along with new innovations becoming available is something that's been considered, but stretches the definition of "Need" and an objective "Standard of Living" scale a bit too far into cynicism for even my liking. The idea that my living standard would be going down as new iPhone is released because <em>I gotta have it</em> is interesting, but doesn't fit with our model's definitions of Needs and SoL.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Rather, focusing your food production on Meat means that this one food type will be used to satisfy both Basic and Luxury Food needs, and since rich Pops have higher purchasing power than poor Pops this will drive the price up for the Basic Food Need as well. Whereas if your food production was focused on Grain, it would be easier for Pops of all kinds to satisfy their Basic Food needs while rich Pops would be forced to pay a premium for their Luxury Foods, which doesn't include Grain as a substitution option.</p>

<p>​It’s Thursday again and that means we’re going to continue talking about politics in games! Specifically, we’ll be talking about Political Movements in Victoria 3. I touched a little bit on this feature back in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Dev Diary #6</a> by saying that there are ways for politically disenfranchised Pops to push for reform, though that isn’t the entirety of the role that Political Movements fill in the game.  </p>
<p>What then are Political Movements? Put simply, a Political Movement is a way for your Pops to make a direct demand of the government, either because they desire change or because they <em>don’t</em> desire the change you are currently pushing through. A Political Movement is always aimed at one particular law, and can take three different forms:  </p>
<p><strong>Movement to Preserve</strong>: This is a political movement that can form when there is sufficient opposition to the passing of a particular law. For example, if Great Britain starts replacing the Monarchy with a Republic, it’s very likely that this will result in a Movement to Preserve the Monarchy.  </p>
<p><strong>Movement to Enact</strong>: This is a political movement that can form when there is a popular demand for the enactment of a particular law. For example, if you have a politically active and literate but very poor underclass of laborers, these laborers might form a movement to create a minimum wage.  </p>
<p><strong>Movement to Restore</strong>: This is a political movement that works exactly like a Movement to Enact, but aims specifically to bring back a law that was previously in effect in the country - for example a Movement to restore the Monarchy in a Britain that successfully transitioned into a Republic. The main difference between a Movement to Restore and a Movement to Enact is that the former will tend to get some extra support from being able to harken back to the ‘golden era’ of the past instead of having to champion new ideas.  </p>
<p>Political Movements have a singular goal and will exist only so long as this goal remains unfulfilled. Their impact on the country in pushing for said goal is determined by their <strong>Support</strong> score. A Political Movement can have support from both Interest Groups (which represents a part of the political establishment backing the movement) and individual Pops (which represents individuals championing the movement in the streets).  </p>
<p><em>Political Movements are not always progressive - while the Industrialists and Intelligentsia want to expand the franchise in Prussia, a coalition of more conservative Interest Groups are simultaneously pushing for more censorship</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2314%20-%20Political%20Movements/2021_08_19_2.png"><img alt="2021_08_19_2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2314%20-%20Political%20Movements/2021_08_19_2.png" title="2021_08_19_2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Political Movements Enact Outlawed Dissent Support: 15% Radicalism: 0% 127K Enact Census Support: 13% Radicalism: 0% 74,3K Suffrage</font></p>
<p>​Interest Groups will provide Support for the Movement based on their Clout, while Pops provide Support based on <strong>raw numbers</strong> (compared to population as a whole), meaning that a single discriminated Laborer backing a Movement provides just as much Support as a fully enfranchised Aristocrat when taking action outside their Interest Group.  </p>
<p>In other words, while Political Strength still plays an important role in Political Movements (in the form of Interest Groups throwing their Clout behind movements championing laws they like), it is entirely possible for a Political Movement to form with no Interest Group backing at all - even if nobody is willing to champion workers’ rights in the halls of power, enough angry workers in the streets may just be enough to affect change anyway.  </p>
<p>Which Interest Groups will or will not back a Political Movement depends on whether they would approve of a change to the new law (in case of Enact/Restore) or disapprove of the current change in progress (in case of Preserve). Interest Groups that have high approval or which are part of the Government will not support Political Movements, though Government IGs may put pressure on you in other ways if they’re not pleased with your actions.  </p>
<p>Pops are more complex, as they can back a Political Movement either because it aligns with their political movement (ie their preferred Interest Group is in favor of the movement) or because they have something to gain directly from it (for example a discriminated Pop backing a movement that would give them more rights).  </p>
<p><em>This Political Movement to abolish the regressive Poll Tax is currently only backed by the Trade Unions and Pops sympathetic to them.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2314%20-%20Political%20Movements/2021_08_19_1.png"><img alt="2021_08_19_1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2314%20-%20Political%20Movements/2021_08_19_1.png" title="2021_08_19_1.png" /></a></p>

<p>​The Support score of a Political Movement has two direct effects on legislation: Firstly, it affects the chance of successfully passing a law (making it easier to pass the law the movement wants in the case of a Movement to Enact/Restore, and more difficult to replace in the case of a Movement to Preserve). Having a Movement to Enact/Restore also allows a country to attempt to pass the law the movement wants, even if said law has no backing among the Interest Groups in government.  </p>
<p>But what then, if you don’t intend to bow to the wishes of a movement in your country? This is where the <strong>Radicalism</strong> of a Political Movement comes in. Radicalism is based on the number of Radical pops and Clout of Angry Interest Groups supporting the Movement. A movement with low Radicalism is one that is intent on getting its wishes heard through peaceful means, while a movement with high Radicalism is willing to use more extreme methods, up to and including sparking a Revolution (though that particular topic is something we’ll cover in a later dev diary).  </p>
<p><em>Replacing the Monarchy with a Republic is </em>not<em> a popular idea in Sweden in 1836 - the opposition is both strong and highly radicalized - a civil war is all but guaranteed unless the government reverses course.</em>  </p>

<p>​It is by no means a sure thing that every peaceful movement will become radical, and movements may very well fizzle out without accomplishing their goal, but ignoring the wishes of a significant part of your population and/or political establishment does come with some associated risks.  </p>
<p>When talking about Political Movement Radicalism, I mentioned Radical Pops, and since they play an important role in creating and radicalizing Political Movements I thought I’d take a little time to explain how Radical Pops and their Loyalist counterparts function in Victoria 3. The first thing that should be understood about Radicals and Loyalists is that just like with Interest Group membership, Radicals and Loyalists are not whole Pops but rather <strong>individuals</strong> within Pops.  </p>
<p><em>Starting a game as France by hiking the taxes up as high as possible and slashing government/military salaries is a sure-fire way to watch the number of Radicals quickly climb</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2314%20-%20Political%20Movements/2021_08_19_3.png"><img alt="2021_08_19_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2314%20-%20Political%20Movements/2021_08_19_3.png" title="2021_08_19_3.png" /></a></p>

<p>​Radicals are individuals who have become disillusioned with the government and political apparatus of the country and want to seek change through any means necessary, while Loyalists are ‘patriots’ who are generally willing to put their political views and goals aside for the sake of the nation. There is a large variety of ways that Pops can become Radicals or Loyalists, here’s a few of the more common reasons listed below:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Pops that experience an increase in material living standards will become more loyal</li>
<li>Pops that experience a decrease in material living standards will become more radical</li>
<li>Pops whose Standard of Living is below the minimum they expect to have will radicalize over time, particularly if it’s so low that they’re actually starving</li>
<li>Pops that are literate but discriminated against tend to radicalize over time</li>
<li>Pops from Political Movements whose demands are ignored may radicalize over time</li>
<li>Pops from Political Movements that have their demands fulfilled become more loyal</li>
</ul>
<p>Radicals and Loyalists generally function in directly opposite ways. For example, Radicals are more likely to create and join Political Movements (as well as contributing to radicalizing said movements) while Loyalists will <strong>never</strong> join Political Movements. Loyalists make the Interest Groups they are part of happier, while Radicals make them less happy and so on. This means that one way to prevent political activism and curtail movements that oppose your agenda is to increase the Standard of Living of your Pops. Just because you at some point during the game created prosperity (and as a result a bunch of Loyalists) doesn’t mean everyone will just be onboard with your programme forever, though.  </p>
<p>Pops will remain Radical or Loyalist until they either die or have a status change as a result of becoming more radical/loyal (for example, a Loyalist Pop might stop being Loyalist if their material standard of living suddenly takes a nosedive), but they do, in fact, die. As generations die off and are replaced by new ones, less and less people will remember all the great things you did for the country 30 years ago and will start wondering instead what you’ve done for them lately.  </p>
<p>With that said, that’s a wrap for this dev diary. Next week we’ll continue talking about Politics on a topic that very much relates to Political Movements by being one of the most monumental political questions of the 19th century: Slavery.</p>

<p>How does policing play into this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radical Pops are a source of Turmoil, which has a number of negative effects on your states. Various Policing Laws provide the Law Enforcement Institution with methods for dealing with the effects of that Turmoil. Some Laws also provide access to Decrees that can have a more direct impact on radical elements of your population. But in both these cases you're dealing with the <em>people</em> who support them, not the Political Movement as an entity. You can't kill an idea.</p>

<p>We'll talk more about technology in another Dev Diary, but our general approach to techs is that they should <em>unlock</em> things, not impose automatic, instant change across your whole country as soon as you get access to them. Most technological change comes with some sort of cost, or at least impact. For example, a more efficient Production Method might come with a new input goods cost or a decreased workforce who need new employment. So I'll hedge this response by first saying that our aim is that even if you can plow through the tech tree early, you should still have to struggle to implement all those novelties by game end.  </p>
<p>With that caveat in mind though: sure, rapid progress means you have to fight even harder to sustain that progress. Any decline in living conditions is unacceptable, after all.</p>

<p>Both would impact their respective Law but not the other one. What's more common is that you start to enact one Law that's demanded by a certain Popular Movement, and once you start that process another Movement forms to Preserve the old Law. In this case the movement to enact the new Law would increase its chance of passing while the movement to preserve the old one would try to cause it to stall, so the final impact would depend on the relative Support values of the two groups.</p>

<p>Promoting the appearance of radical Movements is certainly a thing you can do to effect change to your country rapidly. First off, since radicals are more prone to join Movements, having lots of radicals will make for stronger Movements which let you pass the Laws they want faster and easier. It's also possible to foster a revolution on purpose, though this can be a dangerous gambit and obviously lead to huge loss of life and other devastation to your nation.  </p>

<p>You can attempt to change them as often as you like, but each one is a process - potentially a destabilizing one - and you can only enact one Law at a time. So flip-flopping between Laws is a pretty good way of making just about everyone unhappy in the long run.</p>

<p>A single Pop can only have <em>either</em> Loyalists <em>or</em> Radicals. If the Pop has Loyalists, and become more radical, the effect cancels out the Loyalists instead until there are none left, at which point it would start gaining Radicals instead.  </p>
<p>Deaths reduce Loyalists/Radicals/Literate/Qualifications etc by roughly proportionate amounts, yes. So over time, Pops will trend towards neutrality, faster the shorter their life expectancy is (i.e. if both death rate and birth rate are high).</p>

<p>Oh, none of this has anything to do with votes! Political Movements are about major political will among Interest Groups or grassroots organizations in favor of or opposition to specific Laws.

<p>All of them can get involved on an individual level, but the ones you mention have no or very limited Political Strength and so cannot act through Interest Groups.

<p>If a Movement's demands have gone unfulfilled for a long time, without becoming Radical enough to be able to start a Revolution, it will eventually gain a chance to dissolve randomly.

<p>The main limitation to GUI moddability is what datamodels and UI functions the game exposes. So you could reskin every panel, add or remove decorations and animations, reformat all the data in tooltips, even add shortcut buttons to game actions or related interfaces in different places across the UI. But you cannot, for example, add a new view to the State panel that lists all Pops that are members of Political Movements and have &gt;50% Radicals, along with a button that removes said Pop. The former function would need a specific datamodel to be exposed that filters Pops based on specific criteria, and the latter would require us to expose a UI function to remove a Pop. Since that's not a function that's available anywhere else in the UI, it doesn't exist.  </p>
<p>You could, however, provide a button that triggers an invisible <em>event</em> you've written that silently kills the Pop in question. I think. But don't do it, that'd be very mean.</p>

<p>Yes but in the interviews they did seem to come back to this as the central "gardening" mechanic of the game.

</blockquote>
<p>Satisfying Pop needs is important for the following reasons, among other things:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>higher Standard of Living means greater Pop growth and more immigration, which is often to your benefit  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing a Pop's material conditions leads to more Loyalists which gives you more leeway in the politics you want to push  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it leads to greater consumption of goods which means a larger economy you can exploit via taxes or trade  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's far from the only thing that's important to focus on, and comes with its own challenges like ensuring access to a much wider variety of goods and dealing with Pops that have more time on their hands to be politically active.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA? DEV DIARY #15 SLAVERY</font></p>
<p><strong>It’s Thursday again, which means it’s time for another Victoria 3 development diary.</strong> Today’s subject of slavery is a rather heavy one, being both one of the most significant political issues of the Victorian era as well a story of untold suffering on a human level. For this reason, before I start getting into the mechanics of slavery I want to briefly explain our philosophy behind its representation in Victoria 3.  </p>
<p>Slavery is, obviously, a horrific crime against humanity and precisely for this reason, many games that have a slavery-related setting or mechanics will either leave it out of the game or abstract it into something that’s less ‘on the nose’ (for example by simply applying some form of economic bonus at the expense of decreased stability). For Victoria 3, we don’t think these options work for us for two main reasons.  </p>
<p>The first reason is that as I mentioned before, it was an important political issue of the day and was a major catalyst for several significant conflicts, most notably the American Civil War which would be bizarrely contextless if slavery did not play a significant role in the game. The other, and most important reason, is that through our <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-1-pops.1476573/">Pop system</a> we are trying to represent every individual human on the planet from 1836, so what statement would we be making if we simply wrote all enslaved individuals out of history, or reduced them into an abstract set of modifiers?  </p>
<p>Instead, our aim is to try and represent the institution, systems and causes of slavery, as well as the people who lived under and fought against it, as close to history as we can get it. We simply believe this to be the most respectful way for us to handle this topic, as well as the way that’s most true to the game Victoria 3 aspires to be. With that said, let’s get into the actual mechanics of how slavery and slave pops function in Victoria 3.  </p>
<p>As was mentioned in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-11-employment-and-qualifications.1487723/">Employment and Qualifications</a> dev diary, slaves are what Victoria 2 would have called a ‘Pop Type‘ and Victoria 3 calls a ‘Profession‘, but function in a significantly different way from other Pops. For one, slaves do not get hired with the enticement of a wage and do not have the freedom to choose the place they work. Slaves also aren’t just able to stop being slaves by switching their Profession to one that does offer a wage and freedom of movement.  </p>
<p><em>These Slaves are given the bare minimum of goods not to starve, resulting in a very slight population increase over time but a generally miserable existence for the people that make up the Pop</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2315%20-%20Slavery/2021_09_14_2.png"><img alt="2021_09_14_2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2315%20-%20Slavery/2021_09_14_2.png" title="2021_09_14_2.png" /></a></p>

<p>Buildings that ‘employ’ slaves also do so in a way that differs from the way they employ other Professions. The gist of how this works is that in a state that has slaves, certain buildings (for example plantations) that employ laborers or peasants can fill each available position for those Professions with <em>either</em> a laborer/peasant <em>or</em> a slave. As an example, a Cotton Plantation in a slave state that has the capacity to employ 4000 laborers could fill that capacity with 2240 slaves and 1760 laborers, 4000 laborers and 0 slaves, or any other combination of the two less or equal to 4000. Generally buildings will prefer acquiring slaves over hiring free laborers whenever possible for the economic benefits it brings.  </p>
<p>So what are those economic benefits? Well, first, it should be understood that said economic benefits are mostly for the <em>owners</em> of the <em>building</em>, meaning a bunch of wealthy aristocrats in the case of Cotton Plantations. Instead of paying wages, each building decides a standard of living based on factors such as laws and profitability and purchases the ‘necessary’ goods for that target standard of living. This target SoL may not always be at the level of outright starvation but is never going to be anything but a very basic existence.  </p>
<p>The cost to purchase said goods is simply added as a building expense and is virtually always going to be cheaper than employing paid labor, which translates into lower costs, higher profits and increased dividends for the building owners. Slaves also do not pay taxes in any form, so if the government wants to convert those profits into revenue, they have to do so through the various forms of wealth-based taxes that are always going to be deeply unpopular with the powerful elite.  </p>
<p><em>These Tobacco plantations on Cuba have fully replaced the usual Laborer workforce with Slaves instead, leading to greater wealth for the Aristocrats</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2315%20-%20Slavery/2021_09_14_1.png"><img alt="2021_09_14_1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2315%20-%20Slavery/2021_09_14_1.png" title="2021_09_14_1.png" /></a></p>

<p>However, there is one economic advantage to slavery that goes a little beyond just enriching aristocrats: Slave pops have a higher ratio of workforce to dependents than other pops, meaning that a population of 100k slaves can supply the labor needs of a greater number of buildings than a population of 100k laborers. The key thing here is of course that not all buildings can utilize slaves, so this isn’t going to be doing any good for an industrialized manufacturing economy, but a country that aims to keep its economy agriculture/plantation-focused and suffers from a labor shortage may find the brutal economics of slavery to work in its favor, if they’re willing to stomach the human cost and stamp down on any resistance.  </p>
<p>So what of that resistance? Well, given that slavery is founded entirely on human misery, slaves are naturally not going to be content with their lot in life, and will attempt to resist by whatever means are available to them. Mechanically this translates into a steady stream of radicalized slaves and the threat of turmoil and slave uprisings. This threat to a slave society can usually be averted with sufficiently repressive measures, but fear and violence is not a good foundation for a completely stable country.  </p>
<p>Of course, resistance to slavery doesn’t just come from the slaves themselves, but also from Abolitionists, both internally in your country (in the form of characters and Interest Groups with the Abolitionist ideology) and externally in the form of Abolitionist-led countries that may hinder or put pressure on slave regimes that aren’t strong enough to resist them. The most notable historical example here being Britain and its naval efforts to stamp out the trans-atlantic slave trade in the 19th century.  </p>
<p>With the explanation out of the way, let’s talk about slavery laws. These are what govern who (if anyone) is enslaved or emancipated and where (if anywhere) slavery can exist in your country. They are as follows:  </p>
<p><strong>Slavery Abolished:</strong> The law that most countries with advanced economies start with. Under this law, slavery is completely illegal and on its passage any slave pops in the country are immediately emancipated and converted into laborers. If a country with this law comes into possession of land where slaves are living, said slaves are also immediately emancipated as above.  </p>
<p><strong>Debt Slavery:</strong> This law is meant to represent traditional systems of generally debt-based slavery, present in a number of economically less advanced and/or decentralized countries. Under Debt Slavery, Pops of low Wealth levels will gradually create a trickle of new slaves (with poorer pops converting into slaves at a higher rate), as individuals sell themselves or others into slavery for economic reasons such as debt repayment. However, under this system, children born to slaves are born free, so slave populations will not grow by themselves.  </p>
<p><strong>Slave Trade:</strong> This law is meant to represent the kind of widespread chattel slavery practised in places such as Brazil and Cuba. Under Slave Trade, the children of slaves are born as slaves and new slaves can also be imported from abroad. We’ll not go over exactly how slave import works today, but the gist of it is that slaves can be imported from decentralized countries that practice slavery if the importer has an established Interest in the region (more on Interests at a later point).  </p>
<p><strong>Legacy Slavery:</strong> This law is meant to represent countries that have made slave trade illegal but not abolished it altogether, most notably the United States of America. Under Legacy Slavery, the country is divided into Free States and Slave States. In Free States, slavery is illegal and everything functions exactly as if the country had the Slavery Abolished law, while Slave States function as though they had the Slave Trade law with the notable exception that new slaves cannot be imported from abroad. Under this law, slaves also tend to have a slightly higher standard of living for the simple reason that a starving slave population isn’t demographically sustainable. This law also plays an important role in how the American Civil War functions in the game, but that’s a topic for a later dev diary.  </p>
<p><em>The United States starts the game with the Legacy Slavery law. Surely, nothing will go wrong if they start trying to abolish it right away?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2315%20-%20Slavery/2021_09_14_3.png"><img alt="2021_09_14_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2315%20-%20Slavery/2021_09_14_3.png" title="2021_09_14_3.png" /></a></p>

<p>Since slavery laws function just like any other laws, it is possible for them to change in different ways: a country with Slave Trade may follow the US example and change to Legacy Slavery as a compromise alternative to abolishing it altogether, and a country that has fully abolished slavery can even try to bring it back. Given that no country in history actually re-legalized chattel slavery after abolishing it, this is very difficult to do (once abolished there will generally be a strong anti-slavery bastion in a country that aren’t going to look kindly on such proposals).

<p><font size=1>OCR: cCTORIA DEV DIARY #16 STATES</font></p>
<p>It’s Thursday again and that means it’s time for another Victoria 3 dev diary! Today’s dev diary is going to be a little bit different in that it will mostly be about collecting and further explaining the various mechanics that tie into States. There might not be a whole lot of new information here for people who have been closely following the development, but we feel it’s important to put all this information in the same place and clarify a few points.  </p>
<p>So then, onto the topic of States. States, as we have previously touched on, are the main political-geographical unit of Victoria 3, where pops live and buildings are built. Before we proceed it will be useful to understand the difference between States and State Regions. A State is always controlled by a single country and its borders are dynamic (can change over the course of the game, including being created and destroyed), while State Regions can contain 1 or several States and have static borders (unchanging throughout the game). If a single country owns all provinces within a State Region, there is no practical difference between these concepts. But if more than one country owns provinces within a single State Region, they will each control individual States within it.  </p>
<p>For example, the State Region of Rhineland is a predetermined set of provinces on the border of France that in 1836 contains two States: Prussian Rhineland (actually just called Rhineland because it contains more than half the land in the region) and Bavarian Rhineland (called Bavarian Rhineland to distinguish it from the Prussian parts), a concept that we call a Split State. Over the course of the game, which exact provinces make up the State Region of Rhineland will never change, but the States might. If France was to conquer the Prussian Rhineland, there would of course no longer be a Prussian Rhineland but a French Rhineland, and if Prussia were to conquer the Bavarian Rhineland, the entire State Region would be unified into a single Prussian State.  </p>
<p><em>Political control of the State Region of Rajputana is split between numerous Indian Princes, none of which control enough of the region for their part to be considered Rajputana proper.</em>  </p>

<p>In addition to political ownership, there are a number of conditions that can apply to a State that affects the local population and economy. First of all, there is something called Incorporation Status, representing a State’s political status within the country that owns it. The different Incorporation States are as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporated State: A state that is a fully integrated political unit in the country. This state incurs full bureaucracy costs, pays all forms of taxes required by the government, and gets the benefit of all national Institutions.</li>
<li>Unincorporated State: A state that is owned but only very lightly administered by the country, such as frontier states. Unincorporated states do not incur any bureaucracy costs but only pay certain taxes (such as Consumption Taxes), get no benefits from national Institutions and have reduced Infrastructure.</li>
<li>Colonial State: A state that is considered to be an overseas colony. Works similarly to an Unincorporated State, but also gets increased immigration at the expense of even lower Infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to Incorporate any Unincorporated/Colonial State as long as you have the Bureaucracy that would be needed to properly administer it, but this can be a rocky process - while the increased costs kick in immediately, the benefits (taxes, institutions and so on) are only gradually phased in over time. The time it takes depends on how easy it is for your country to integrate the local population - it would be a lot more difficult for Britain to incorporate an Indian state than it would be for them to incorporate the Falklands, for example.  </p>
<p>Other conditions that can apply to a State include (not an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li>Capital State: The political capital of a country. All Pops living in the Capital State have increased political power.</li>
<li>Market Capital: The economic capital of a country. Has increased Infrastructure and Migration Attraction.</li>
<li>Turmoil: A State that has too many political radicals (as a percentage of population) will experience Turmoil. A State with Turmoil suffers penalties in the form of increased Tax Waste and reduced Migration Attraction. These penalties can be reduced by investing into the Police institution.</li>
</ul>

<li>Claims: A State Region can be claimed by a country that does not currently own it but are broadly considered to have a legitimate reason to think that maybe they should. We’ll come back to this when talking about diplomacy and war.</li>
<li>Homelands: Every Culture has one or more State Regions that most people in that Culture consider to be their natural homeland. This does not consider the views of anyone else outside that Culture (ie, the Swedes don’t get any say in which State Regions the Russians consider to be their homelands and vice versa), and has certain effects that we will go over in later dev diaries.</li>

<p>As mentioned all the way back in the dev diary about Buildings, States are limited in which Resource Industry Building Types they can support and how large these can get. For example, the degree of Iron deposits in a state limits how many levels of Iron Mine you can build there. These resource limits are actually a property of State Regions, which is dynamically allocated to the States in the region based on how large of a share the State holds.  </p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this proportion isn’t just based on the raw number of provinces owned. As an example, potential for Fisheries are distributed according to the amount of coastline a State has in the State Region, while Arable Land land can be heavily weighted by the amount of Prime Land is in each State. While not applicable everywhere, Prime Land is something we use in states where there is a clear division between fertile and non-fertile land - control of the Nile should matter a lot more to a State in Upper Egypt’s Arable Land than control of the surrounding desert, for example.  </p>
<p>It’s also possible for a State Region to contain Discoverable Resources. These are resources such as Oil, Gold or Rubber that are either not known about or not considered exploitable at the start of the game, but may be discovered and exploited at a later point. Certain technologies will affect both which resources can be discovered and the actual chance of said resource being discovered. All of this functions in a weighted random fashion, so while the chance of there being a Klondike gold rush at some point during the game is high, it probably won’t happen exactly at the same date it did historically.  </p>

<p>Also, can we make an incorporated state into an unincorporated one like in eu4, thus freeing beaurocracy for incorporating another one?</p>

<p>Claims and Homelands are quite separate mechanics. A Claim is essentially a country having a rightful cause to take land, and you get a Claim if a fully incorporated state is conquered from you. Homelands is more about where a culture feels their natural homelands lie, and while there's some interaction with diplomacy/war there, it isn't as simple as Anhalt having just cause to take over Prussia because it's North German Homelands.</p>

<p>Will the province level still matter when it comes to building factories. So for example if a part of the state are mountain provinces will the whole state get an infrastructure penalty even if the large cities are in plains and therefore the mountains would not matter when it comes to railroadconstruction? And in the case of mines, will the provinces that historically would contain them also get the construction potential if you split the state/conquer only that part with the mine? instead of for example every province gets 1/10 of the max mine capacity regardless of where it actually is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't have province mechanics on this level - nothing is built on the province level. The state does know if a Pop is in say, the city or the countryside, and we can potentially do things like splitting off the entire urban population into one state in a partition if that state contains the entire city, but we haven't really gone deeply into partition mechanics as of yet.</p>

<p>There are events and the like that can add Claims, and some Claims are defined historically. I don't see Prussia starting with a Claim on Alsace but they could possibly get one during the leadup to forming Germany (I don't think this is a thing in the current build though).</p>

<p>We know what Pops are in which Buildings, we know where the different city hubs are in the state, and we can reasonably compute which province a given number of levels of a building might be in. What this means is that we can determine <em>as-needed</em> which Pop "might" be in which province. This is then used to determine which Pops, building levels, etc go where in case of a split.  </p>
<p>This saves us from tracking the mostly-useless information of which Pop is in which province at any given time, which would bloat the game a <em>lot</em>, but still lets us approximate it as needed. Otherwise we'd have to, for example, split a single Peasant Pop of 1 million people into 50 Pops of 20,000 people each if those Peasants are equally spread across the state's 50 provinces, even though by our game rules they could all pack up and take another job in the same state tomorrow.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 17 MIGRATION</font></p>
<p>​Hello and welcome to yet another Victoria 3 dev diary. Today’s topic is Migration (meaning the movement of Pops between states), what role it plays in Victoria 3, and how it functions mechanically. There are two types of Migration in Victoria 3: <em>Intra-Market Migration</em> and <em>Mass Migration</em>, and we’ll be explaining both of these starting with Intra-Market Migration.  </p>
<p>Intra-Market Migration is the movement of Pops between two States that are part of the same Market. Barring certain exceptions (such as slaves not being able to migrate, as covered in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-16-states.1491897/">previous dev diary</a>), Pops are generally always able to move between States in the Market, though the number of individuals that are able to change their homes on a weekly basis varies based on factors such as the local <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-10-infrastructure.1485696/">Infrastructure</a> and Market Access in the two States.  </p>
<p>Which Pops migrate from and to what States depends on the Migration Attraction of each State. Migration Attraction is a value that is based on the average Standard of Living in the state, and modified by various factors such as over/underpopulation, unemployment/available jobs and so on. It is possible for a country to directly encourage Migration to a specific state through the ‘Greener Grass Campaign’ Decree, at the cost of some Authority. In general, Pops will move from States with a low standard of living and a lack of employment opportunities to states with a high standard of living and jobs to offer. States with a low population compared to the amount of available land are especially attractive to economic immigrants.  </p>
<p><em>Kansas, already an attractive state for American settlers due to its sparse population, has been further prioritized for migration through the use of a Greener Grass Campaign decree</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2317%20-%20Migration/image1.png"><img alt="image1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2317%20-%20Migration/image1.png" title="image1.png" /></a></p>

<p>​Discrimination, too, plays a role in migration. Pops that are being discriminated against in a particular State, and have the opportunity to migrate to another State in that market where they would not be discriminated against (perhaps because of multiple countries sharing the same Market, and one of those countries having more liberal citizenship or religious laws) will take that opportunity in greater numbers, provided of course that there is an underlying economic reason for them to want to move there in the first place. After all, while enjoying voting rights is certainly nice, putting food on the table is higher on the agenda for most Pops.  </p>
<p>Discrimination can also have the opposite effect: Pops that are already enjoying full citizen rights are generally going to need to be in pretty dire economic straits to consider moving somewhere where those rights are going to be taken away, and in the case of a Pop that is going to be discriminated against no matter where they go in the Market, they tend to stick to their cultural Homelands.  </p>
<p><em>French colonial settlement policies means that their colony of Algiers receives a steady trickle of immigrants from mainland France every week</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2317%20-%20Migration/image2.png"><img alt="image2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2317%20-%20Migration/image2.png" title="image2.png" /></a></p>

<p>​So, what then of Mass Migration? Mass Migration is a mechanic introduced to try and model the migration of large amounts of people to places such as the US, Brazil and Australia in the 19th century. Mass Migration can happen when a particular culture experiences Turmoil, which is a product of having a large number of radicalized pops. A culture that has enough Turmoil to meet the threshold has a chance to create a Migration Target somewhere in the world, which is a flag set on a particular State that attracts huge numbers of migrants from that culture over the course of a limited timespan to that State and any States neighboring it.  </p>
<p>Migration Targets are more likely to be created if the Pops in the culture have a low Standard of Living and high Literacy, and particularly likely to be created if there is widespread starvation among the Pops of that culture.  </p>
<p>The selection of States for Migration Targets is based on a number of factors, including the state’s Migration Attraction, whether or not the culture is legally discriminated against in the country, and if there is a logical ‘path’ that Pops of the migrating culture would be able to follow from their Homelands to the target (such as trade routes). There is no inherent advantage in certain country ‘tags’ for who gets migrants - the US tends to get migrations because of availability of jobs and land combined with liberal citizenship laws, not because they have a built-in migration attraction bonus.  </p>
<p><em>Fed up with economic hardship and political oppression in their homelands, a large group of Polish people have decided to try their luck at a new life in France</em>  </p>

<p>​There is one more aspect of migration that we’re only going to briefly touch on: Migration Policy. This is a group of Laws which lets you set the stance of your country on migration. For example, whether you want to promote the movement of people from your core lands to your colonies, attract skilled workers from other countries for your manufacturing economy, or even just minimize all migration (external and internal) as a way of maintaining your iron grip over the population. The reason we won’t be going into this today is because it’s currently in the process of being redesigned to this end (from a previous, much simpler set of laws). We’ll try to return to it at a later time!  </p>
<p>With that said, we’ve reached the end of this dev diary, and in fact, the end of the current string of politics dev diaries, as next we’ll be changing our focus from inwards to outwards and talking about Diplomacy, on the topic of Prestige and Rank!</p>

<p>No, countries have fixed primary culture (one or several) and this does not change other than if the country's definition changes (e.g. through forming a new nation).

<p>Discrimination law effects are measured against the primary cultures, so a large population of non-primary culture immigrants may demand equal treatment or pack up and move elsewhere, or even demand self-governance under certain conditions.</p>

<p>Cultural Assimilation and Religious Conversion are separate mechanics which we'll cover in a later DD, but these will often come into play after a migration wave.  </p>

<p>It's based on cultures yes, just because the Migration Target exists doesn't mean that all Pops of that culture will automatically be pulled toward it. The well-to-do Pops won't be interested in moving, even if the presence of the Migration Target means they technically could.</p>

<p>If there are enough wealthy Pops to markedly increase the average, then the immigrant will be hearing about the glorious country overseas where the streets are paved with gold, scrape together enough to embark to this promised land, but perhaps find themselves stuck due to poor social mobility once they get there.

</blockquote>
<p>War can have a number of deleterious effects on a society simply due to emergent mechanics affecting the Pops. We will learn more about this in later DDs. This means that prolonged wars definitely can cause migration waves away from the war-torn country, or perhaps just shift the population away from the worst affected region to other parts of the market.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27821942">lachek reqplied to Victoria 3 - Dev Diary #17 - Migration</a></h4>
<p>A couple of general answers:  </p>
<p>Anything pertaining to encouraging or discouraging certain kinds of migration will be dealt with via the as-yet-unfinished Migration Policy Laws.  </p>
<p>When I mentioned a cultural minority might "demand self-governance" under certain conditions I'm referring to the Secession mechanics, which we will talk about in the future.  </p>
<p>There is no direct interaction with Pops in Victoria 3, all interaction are through other mediums like Buildings, Interest Groups, Decrees, Institutions etcetera. Similarly there are no direct interactions with cultures or religions, for example you're not able to ban or encourage migration of Pops of a specific culture. All such interaction is handled through the Citizenship and Church &amp; State Laws, which determine if a Pop is Discriminated due to culture and/or religion. It's the distinction between non-Discriminated and Discriminated Pops that determine how specific policies work, rather than selecting a specific policy for a specific kind of person. Not denying that happened on occasion, but it's certainly less common and not the level of granularity we want the game to operate on.  </p>
<p>We've considered and experimented with adjacency-based migration in the past, but ended up deciding not to have 3 distinct systems for migration in the game. Economic migration (poor Pops moving to where the jobs are) is handled via market migration. Turmoil-based migration (destitute or oppressed Pops moving abroad) is handled via mass migration. While cross-border migration as well as a steady trickle of global migrants are certainly not ahistorical, it is irrelevant for a player when the effect is very low and difficult to explain or do something about when it's already very high. Economic migration is usually something a player is happy for and can control to some degree with Decrees, while Mass Migration is easier to signal and explain to the player and can be controlled with Laws. The effects of other forms of migration are also less relevant to model and would result in a lot of Pop fracturing (and performance problems) for no major discernible benefit.</p>

<p>They will migrate if they see a benefit in doing so, either economic or political. So it depends on how relatively attractive the target country is to them.</p>

<p>So, no dynamic culture, no way of finely managing cultures (a la imperator/Stellaris) other that a primary vs others binary? That is the most disappointing post I've read so far...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discrimination Laws are a bit more granular than just "primary vs others" and together with the two discrimination vectors (culture + religion) can create quite a bit of detail. Being able to effectively target your "culture management" with a finer legal instrument than that is both unrealistic and not particularly meaningful in terms of what it adds to the gameplay.  </p>
<p>Having said that, it's well worth noting that our decision to make Primary Culture(s) static to the country tag is very intentional. In addition to being set in the revolutionary era, Victoria 3 is also set in the era of nationalism and the notion that culture = country, "natural" cultural homelands, pan-national sentiments, and so on are important themes. So in Victoria 3, culture and country are intrinsically connected as it would be nonsensical in this era for a nation-state to change its primary cultures while still retaining its fundamental national identity.</p>

<p>Can Mass Migration be triggered by less dramatic circumstances than starvation? Italy during the second half of the 19th century experienced a very significative emigration toward America, yet, despite widespread poverty, it wasn't so dramatic like the famine in Ireland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mass Migration is triggered by average Turmoil in a culture, and Turmoil in turn comes from Radicalism and Discrimination. Radicalism gets particularly high in Pops that are starving, but for example if most Pops of a certain culture used to be really well off but then became oppressed and a lot poorer in their current country / countries, this could cause a Migration Target for them to go elsewhere as well.</p>

<p>Can migration cause a backlash at the destination? Or will this generally not happen, because they’ll probably pick someplace with plenty of job openings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know I sound like a broken record, but this emerges from the simulation!  </p>
<p>Backlash isn't something created by the migration itself but rather emerging from the effects of that migration. If the people moving have a lot of Radicals, as they're prone to have since Mass Migration is triggered by high average Turmoil in the culture, this will impact the state they're moving to and by extension also the other Pops who live there. If the moving Pops become non-Discriminated in the process and perhaps are able to fill job opportunities that increase their Standard of Living, this Turmoil will dissipate quite rapidly and is unlikely to cause long-term problems. But if the immigrating Pops continue to be oppressed and can't improve their living conditions in their new country, this could become a problem for everybody.  </p>
<p>Getting a little more granular about it, a major influx of potential labor with low expectations can also depress wages by making it unnecessary for profitable buildings to raise their wage rates to increase their attractiveness. This could aggravate stratification of the owner/shareholder classes and the working classes in the state, creating Radicals among the local population. But on the other hand, this additional labor might be exactly what is needed to expand production of local staple goods, making it cheaper to satisfy those needs. So while migration waves will always have a substantial effect on your economy and therefore politics, the precise effect it will have all comes down to the details and how you choose to deal with it.</p>

<p>So, to use the example of Argentina that someone advanced: say that a mass Italian migration results in a majority of Italians living in (some states of) Argentina.  </p>
<p>Assuming that Argentina's primary culture is Spanish, and given that no "easy" (i.e., through laws) way to add primary cultures is possible, will disgruntled Italians form separatist movements to secede the Italian-majority states?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Italians in Argentina won't form separatist movements, as opposed to e.g. Italians in Austria-occupied Italy. The reason for this is because no part of Argentina is considered an Italian Homeland, so Italian people in Argentina will always consider themselves immigrants - at least unless they assimilate into the primary culture. Discriminated or otherwise unhappy Italians in Argentina will become a semi-permanent source of Turmoil, but this might be compensated for - at least in the short-term - through increased living standards.  </p>
<p>In the long-term you can only eliminate this source of Turmoil through discontinuing your discriminatory laws, which is always an option. If the primary culture is Spanish then the only reason Italian Pops would be (culturally) discriminated is if Argentina has the "National Supremacy" Citizenship Law, the most restrictive option. Due to their shared European heritage, Italians would be accepted even under the second-most severe Citizenship Law, "Racial Segregation".</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA Kal DEV DIARY # 18 RANK ( PRESTIGE eopialt K h i v a 'Sea Bukhara Aghanisy Persia Persian Cull</font></p>
<p>​Happy Thursday and welcome to a brand new dev diary for Victoria 3! Today we’re finally switching away from talking about economy and politics and starting on a string of Diplomacy-oriented dev diaries, of which the first is this one, where we’ll be covering Rank and Prestige, two interconnected mechanics that play a very central role in how diplomatic matters play out in the game.  </p>
<p>Rank is a mechanic that also existed in both previous Victoria games, and is a measure of how glorious and influential a country is in the eyes of the rest of the world. What Rank a country has - be it a mighty Great Power or a largely irrelevant Unrecognized Power - is determined by two factors: Prestige (which we’ll be explaining below) and Recognition.  </p>
<p>When talking about Recognition, it’s important to note that we are not talking about Recognition in the more commonly used term when applying to nations, that is, whether other countries recognize the nation’s independence and existence in the first place. Rather, it is a measure of whether the reigning (probably mostly European) Great Powers, as a whole, see the country as a <em>potential equal</em>, i.e. whether the country could potentially be included as a decision-maker in said system if they grew strong enough.   </p>
<p>We’re not going to go too deep into this specific topic today (as we’ll return to it in a later dev diary), but the gist of it is that countries start the game either Unrecognized or Recognized, and Unrecognized countries have to gain or force recognition in order to properly climb the Rank ladder. The Unrecognized/Recognized system replaces the Civilized/Uncivilized system of Victoria 1 and 2, and a difference from those games is that being an Unrecognized country is purely a <em>Diplomatic</em> status with <em>Diplomatic</em> penalties - a country does not become inherently worse at constructing factories or fighting wars by virtue of being scorned by Metternich and his friends, though many countries with Unrecognized status do also start out on the lower end of the technological scale.  </p>
<p><em>Though it has among the highest Prestige ratings in the world, Great Qing’s status as an Unrecognized Country severely limits its potential rank among the nations of the world</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2318%20-%20Rank%20%26%20Prestige/Qing.png"><img alt="Qing.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2318%20-%20Rank%20%26%20Prestige/Qing.png" title="Qing.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Rank Great currently holds the Rank of Unrecognized Power with an overall score position of #80 in the world: Current Prestige: 1122 If the Prestige of Great is reduced below 55 for an extended time; their Rank will decrease to Unrecognized Minor Power Great cannot achieve higher Rank than Unrecognized Power due to their Unrecognized Country status, limiting them to maximum score position of #80 in the world Qing Qing Qing</font></p>
<p>​All in all, there are six different ranks that a country can occupy in Victoria 3, as well as a special seventh rank that only applies to Decentralized (non-playable) nations and so isn’t of any real interest to talk about today (please note that the names of some of these may be subject to change):  </p>
<ul>
<li>Great Power: These are the most powerful and glorious of nations and often have a global reach, getting involved in far-off conflicts. The most obvious example of a Great Power at the start of the game is Great Britain.</li>
<li>Major Power: These are regional powerhouses that often decide the course of conflicts in their home regions and may have a limited global presence. An example of a Major Power at the start of the game is the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.</li>
<li>Minor Power: These are regional powers that may be important for determining how a local conflict in their home region turns out but are generally irrelevant on the world stage. An example of a Minor Power at the start of the game is Mexico.</li>
<li>Insignificant Power: These are nations that generally do not even have the ability to influence the outcome of local conflicts and can be safely ignored by anyone other than other Insignificant Powers in their immediate vicinity. An example of an Insignificant Power at the start of the game is the Free City of Krakow.</li>
<li>Unrecognized Power: These are Unrecognized Powers that are powerful and prestigious enough to throw their weight on a regional stage, try to resist the demands of the Recognized powers and to be a potential candidate for recognition. An example of an Unrecognized Power at the start of the game is the Qing Empire.</li>
<li>Unrecognized Minor Power: These are Unrecognized Powers that generally lack the power to go up against anyone other than the weakest of Recognized powers, and will often find themselves at the mercy of Great and Major Powers and having to play them against each other to survive. An example of an Unrecognized Minor Power at the start of the game is the Kingdom of Nepal.</li>
</ul>
<p>So then, what benefits do Rank confer? Generally, the higher a country’s Rank, the more <em>Influence</em> <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-2-capacities.1477662/">capacity</a> it generates (allowing for a greater freedom in conducting diplomacy and signing diplomatic pacts), the more <em>Declared Interests</em> it can support (more on that next week) and the more <em>Maneuvers</em> it has in Diplomatic Plays (more on that in a few weeks). Rank also plays a key role in many other systems such as Subjects, Infamy, Diplomatic Actions and more, some of which we’ll get into in the coming weeks (I know I keep saying that, but bear with me, we’ve only just started on Diplomacy!).  </p>
<p><em>France starts the game as the second Great Power, just behind Britain in Prestige</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2318%20-%20Rank%20%26%20Prestige/France%20-%20Great%20Power.png"><img alt="France - Great Power.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2318%20-%20Rank%20%26%20Prestige/France%20-%20Great%20Power.png" title="France - Great Power.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Rank France currently holds the Rank of Great Power with an overall score position of #2 in the world: Current Prestige: 730 If the Prestige of France is reduced below 219 for an extended time; their Rank will decrease to Major Power Information Modifiers Diplomacy 260 105 GDP 2 38.1M Population 33.87M Literacy 34.94% Standard of 9.15 State Religion Catholic Government: HM'$ Government Cultures French Arable Land 26.706 1113 Living Prinary</font></p>
<p>​Prestige, as was mentioned above, plays a central role in all of this. Simply put, Prestige is what determines who gets to occupy what rank in the global pecking order. Unlike in Victoria 1 and Victoria 2, where Prestige was just one of three factors determining what Rank a country had, in Victoria 3 Prestige is the accumulation of <em>all</em> factors that makes a country more or less glorious. In order to become a certain rank, a country must meet the Prestige threshold for that rank, which is based on both how it compares to the global average and percentile-wise compared to the most prestigious country.   </p>
<p>To explain what I mean by that, here is a look at the current requirements to be a Great Power:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Must be a Recognized country</li>
<li>Must not be a Subject of any other nation</li>
<li>Must have at least 3 times the average global prestige OR at least 75% of the prestige of the most prestigious nation</li>
</ul>
<p>This means two things: The number of Great Powers, Major Powers and so on is not fixed to a specific number (as it was in Victoria 1 and 2, where you would always have 8 of each), and that the requirements to maintain and increase your Rank will change over the course of the game. A country might start as a Great Power due to their starting prestige, but then begin quickly falling behind due to economic and military stagnation, eventually being reduced to a Major Power even though their actual Prestige number never went down.  </p>
<p><em>Persia is able to occupy a rank position above what its economy and army can support through considerable investment into the arts</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2318%20-%20Rank%20%26%20Prestige/Persia%20-%20Prestige.png"><img alt="Persia - Prestige.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2318%20-%20Rank%20%26%20Prestige/Persia%20-%20Prestige.png" title="Persia - Prestige.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Rank Persia currently holds the Rank of Unrecognized Power with an overall Kaza score position of #87 in the world: Current Prestige: 127 Prestige of Persia: 127 pw 59 for an extended time; their or Power From Country Tier of Kingdom: +50 From Gross Domestic Product: +16 than Unrecognized Power due to Information From Army Power Projection: +18 Iting them to maximum score From Power Projection: +3 +20 from Arts Academy in Laristan +20 from Arts Academy in Sistan 45 +10.0% from Ruler Trait Imperious 82 re GDP E2.8M Population 6.16M Literacy 15.32% Standard of 6.26 State Religion Shiite Government: Kingdom Primary Cultures Persian_ Azerbaijani Arable Land 35.8% 15.3% 296 Infamy Reputable Caspiaxk K h i v a Seu Bukhara Navy Aghanista Persia Living Kalv Persian N e j d Gull 1 States Trucial:</font></p>
<p>​So, what is it that can give a country Prestige? The answer is… a whole lot of things! Here’s a look at some of these things, though it’s by <em>no means</em> an exhaustive list:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The Tier of a Country (whether it’s considered a City-State, Principality, Kingdom or so on) gives it a little bit of base-level Prestige. This is inherent to a specific nation and can only be increased by forming a new, more glorious nation.</li>
<li>Having a large Army gives Prestige, with more Prestige being given based on its ability to both fight effectively and look imposing.</li>
<li>Having a large, powerful and impressive-looking Navy gives Prestige to an even greater degree than the Army.</li>
<li>The total GDP (and thus indirectly level of industrialization) of a country gives it Prestige.</li>
<li>Subjects contribute Prestige to their Suzerain based on their military and economic might.</li>
<li>Being a global leader (first, second or third) in the production of a Good gives a country Prestige, with some Goods being more prestigious than others.</li>
<li>Building and supporting Art Academies (being a sponsor of the art) gives Prestige.</li>
<li>Successful undertaking of certain globally recognized projects, such as undertaking major expeditions to certain regions of the world or the construction of a canal can give a country a permanent increase in its Prestige.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it for today, but we’re of course only getting started on talking about this part of the game, so next week I will return with another dev diary covering several different Diplomacy-related mechanics, namely Relations, Infamy and Interests.</p>

<p>And <strong>please don't put the EIC as the 8th strongest "nation"</strong> in the game. It's insane. The EIC was by no means the 7th most powerful "nation" in the world in 1836. And I think it is a very bad decision gameplay wise too (EIC shouldn't have enough power to intervine in Europe in 1836, for example).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The list isn't based on us manually ranking countries, it's based on how the game currently calculates prestige, which is a calculation that is likely going to change before release. I don't think the way V2 calculates it is necessarily correct either - Prussia was definitely not stronger than Austria in 1836 for example as far as my understanding of history goes.</p>

<p>They did not fight any wars in 1836. Prussia grew stronger than Austria in the coming decades but their position in 1836 was not a terribly strong one. 1866 it's a whole other picture, but the game doesn't start in 1866.</p>

<p>That seems like it could make the problem of too few/too many nations worse, as it might be much easier to have 10% of all prestige if there's 20 nations than if there are 200.

<p>If one nation really runs away with it, does it still make sense for others to be viewed as Great Powers? Let's say a nation has more than 3x global average, but less than say 25% of the leader, should it still be considered a GP?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intent is to try and avoid a runaway scenario where there is just one Great Power left due to the impact that would have on various diplomatic mechanics. I think if we want to simulate a power rising above the other Great Powers we should think about adding a rank above Great Power instead.</p>

<p>1) GDP is tie breaker for two countries of the exact same prestige.  </p>
<p>2) If everyone had the exact same prestige everyone would be a Great Power but due to the various normalization mechanics built into the game, this basically cannot happen short of some extreme modding.</p>

<p>Just to re-emphasise, those rankings are not final and probably not really correct. For instance, the US probably shouldn't be #5 and the EIC probably shouldn't be #8. Whether Spain should start as a Great Power or a Major Power is something where I haven't really made up my mind honestly.</p>

<p>They are WIP values, as indicated by the WIP images placed on the screenshots. Final balancing of all values isn't done until close to release. In fact, one thing will often do during development is to set overpowered values to things on purpose, so we can see how it feels to play with and gradually adjust down. The reason we do this is that setting values on a feature too low from the start can lead to testers ignoring the feature and it being more or less forgotten about.</p>

<p>A country under the dominion of another is largely subservient to its overlord in diplomatic matters. If someone wants to mess with the EIC they're also forced to deal with Great Britain, so their Recognition status is largely irrelevant under these circumstances.  </p>
<p>But what really matters is what happens if a Subject nation gains its independence. If EIC decided to mount a rebellion against the Crown and successfully became an independent Major Power in the Indian subcontinent, would the Great Powers treat it with some modicum of respect or would they be considered irrelevant other than as a ripe target for exploitation? The game mechanics argue that the former makes more sense.  </p>
<p>And to be clear, if an Unrecognized country is Puppeted and subsequently Released, its status as Unrecognized remains.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 19 RELATIONS Q INFAMY</font></p>
<p>​Hello and welcome to another Victoria 3 dev diary! This one is going to be a little bit broad, as we want to go through the fundamental mechanics of Diplomacy before moving on to more specific topics. Today, the mechanics we’ll be going over are Relations, Infamy and Interests, so let’s get to them one at a time, shall we?  </p>
<p>Starting out with Relations, this is a value on a scale between -100 and +100 that determines the overall diplomatic standing between two countries, similar to relations/opinion in games such as Europa Universalis and Stellaris. The key difference between Relations here and in those games is that in Victoria 3 relations are <em>bilateral</em>, meaning that while in Europa Universalis France can have a relations of -100 with Prussia while Prussia has a relations of +100 with France, in Victoria 3 these two countries will always have the same Relations score towards each other.   </p>
<p>There’s a few reasons for this change, such as making it more clear exactly where two countries stand with each other, but the most important is that we want Relations to be a mechanic with significance and mechanical effects not just for AI countries but also for the player, and even in multiplayer. Your relation number will translate into a relations level, and the different relations levels are as follows (from highest to lowest): Warm (80-100), Amiable (50-79), Cordial (20-49), Neutral (-19 to 19), Poor (-20 to -49), Cold (-50 to -79), Hostile (-80 to -100).  </p>
<p><em>Your relationship with the Great Powers will be especially important, as they are the ones with the global reach to potentially affect you no matter where your country is located</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/Country%20List.png"><img alt="Country List.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/Country%20List.png" title="Country List.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP COUNTRIES Country Relations Great Britain Hostile France Neutral United States of America Cordial Russia Neutral Austria Cordial Prussia Cold Ottoman Empire Cold East India Company Cold Spain Cold #10 Netherlands Cold #11 Bavaria Cold #12 Sweden Neutral</font></p>
<p>All of these have an impact on the AI’s decision-making in terms of which diplomatic proposals it will accept, which side it will want to join in diplomatic plays, and so on, but besides that there are also limitations on what actions you can take against another country based on your mutual Relations. For example, a relations level of Cordial or above acts as a non-aggression pact: It isn’t possible to start most Diplomatic Plays against a country with which you have that relation level without first acting to reduce said relations. On the flip side, signing and maintaining a Customs Union with a country requires you to be at or above Cordial relations, and there are other actions that cannot be taken unless relations are at other certain negative or positive thresholds.  </p>
<p>So, how do you raise and lower relations? The primary way is through the Improve Relations and Damage Relations ongoing diplomatic actions (more on those next week), but there’s many other ways in which relations can be increased or decreased, including various events, Diplomatic Incidents (see the section on Infamy below) and the Expel Diplomats diplomatic action (which we’ll also go over in detail next week), which is a way in which one country can act to prevent another from cozying up to them relations-wise, though at the cost of gaining Infamy.  </p>
<p><em>Here, France finds itself with few friends in Europe - the only other Great Power they have decent relations with is Austria, and it seems like it may not stay that way...</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/Diplomatic%20Relations%20Map%20Alt.png"><img alt="Diplomatic Relations Map Alt.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/Diplomatic%20Relations%20Map%20Alt.png" title="Diplomatic Relations Map Alt.png" /></a></p>

<p>That covers Relations, so let’s move on to Infamy. This is a system we have previously talked about a little under the name of Threat, implying that it works similarly to Aggressive Expansion in Europa Universalis, but is actually something we have since redesigned following tester feedback, as the very localized effects of Threat/Aggressive Expansion did not feel appropriate to the far more globalized Victorian era. The result is something that could be described as a hybrid between older Infamy (or ‘Badboy’ as those of you who have been around Paradox GSGs for a long time might recall) systems and the newer, more localized systems.  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3, a country has an Infamy value that starts at 0 and can increase to… well, anything, as there’s no upper cap on it. As a country’s Infamy increases, other countries will become more wary, resulting in various diplomatic penalties for the infamous country.If Infamy exceeds the Pariah threshold (which is currently set to 100) the country becomes a potential target for a special Contain Threat diplomatic play where the Great Powers step in to ‘restore order’. Infamy decays slowly over time, and its rate of decay can be increased if the country has a large amount of unallocated Influence capacity, representing that capacity being put to use trying to salvage the country’s global reputation instead.  </p>
<p><em>After making some aggressive moves against its neighbors, Bolivia’s infamy has increased to the point where they will start feeling some diplomatic effects - though it’s not yet too bad</em>  </p>

<p>​So far this should probably sound very familiar to anyone who has played Victoria 2, but the key difference between Victoria 3 and its predecessor here is the Diplomatic Incident mechanic tied to Infamy. In the vast majority of cases, any action a country takes (for example demanding land in a Diplomatic Play or violating a neutral country’s sovereignty during war) that increases Infamy will also create a Diplomatic Incident localized at a particular Strategic Region (more on that below) on the map.   </p>
<p>For example, starting a Diplomatic Play to demand a colony in West Africa will result in a Diplomatic Incident occurring there. Whenever a Diplomatic Incident happens, the country that caused it immediately suffers a penalty to their relations with all countries that have an Interest in the region, with the amount of Relations lost based on the amount of Infamy attached to the Incident in question.  </p>
<p>Infamy in itself should be understood as a measure of how concerned the Great Powers are about a country, and as such, country Rank has an effect on how much Infamy a country gets when it commits a diplomatic transgression against another. Generally speaking, the lower the rank of the two countries involved, the less Infamy will be generated, as the Great Powers care a lot more about actions taken by and against other Great Powers than they do over two Minor Powers being engaged in a local squabble.  </p>
<p><em>The Sikh Empire’s ambitions on India are not going to go unnoticed by countries with an Interest there</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/2021_10_07_3.png"><img alt="2021_10_07_3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/2021_10_07_3.png" title="2021_10_07_3.png" /></a></p>

<p>​Ultimately, what this means is that Infamy doesn’t <em>just</em> have a global effect, and where you’re accruing it matters. If you keep taking actions that destabilize a particular Strategic Region, you can expect to quickly become very unpopular with both the locals and any outside powers that have taken an Interest in it.  </p>
<p>By now, I’ve said the word Interest a whole bunch of times, so it’s probably time to finally explain what they are. To do that though, I first have to explain the concept of Strategic Regions. A Strategic Region is a large predetermined geographic area consisting of a number of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-16-states.1491897/">State Regions</a>, with the 715 State Regions of the current internal build divided into a total of 49 Strategic Regions.  </p>
<p><em>A look at the Strategic Regions of Europe - do note that as with all parts of the map, this may not be how it looks on release!</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/Strategic%20Regions.png"><img alt="Strategic Regions.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2319%20-%20Relations%20and%20Infamy/Strategic%20Regions.png" title="Strategic Regions.png" /></a></p>

<p>Interests is, put simply, a mechanic that determines whether or not a country has a stake in a particular Strategic Region and plays into numerous different mechanics such as Diplomatic Plays, Colonization and the aforementioned Diplomatic Incidents. A country can gain an Interest in a region in one of two ways: either automatically by having a geographical presence there (owning land or controlling subject nations in the region) or by using a Declared Interest.  </p>
<p>A Declared Interest is a country quite simply saying that, regardless of their lack of a geographic presence, a Strategic Region is still of importance to them, perhaps because they plan to colonize it, or because they want to prevent a hated rival from expanding into it. A country can Declare an Interest in any region that is either adjacent to a region where they already have an Interest, or which they can reach through the support of their naval supply network (more on that later!). The number of Declared Interests that is available to a country depends on their Rank - a Great Power can choose to have its fingers in a great many pies, while an Insignificant Power is limited to acting only in regions where they already have land.  </p>
<p><em>You might want to declare an Interest in Persia for numerous reasons, such as checking Russian or British aggression in the region… or as a precursor to seizing colonies there for yourself</em>  </p>

<p>​Interests do not provide any inherent benefit to a country besides the ability to throw their weight around in a Strategic Region, and can actually be a bit of a double-edged sword in that a country with Interests all over the world may get dragged into a lot of local conflicts. Ultimately, Interests are our attempt to simulate such historical occurrences as why certain parts of the world simply got a lot more attention from the Great Powers than others at particular points during the century that Victoria 3 covers, and to make nations act and care about things in a way that makes sense according to their national self-interest.  </p>
<p>Right then, that’s all for today! Join me again next week as I continue to write lots of words about diplomatic things, this time on the topic of Diplomatic Actions!</p>

<p>Relations measures the two countries' official diplomatic stance towards one another. You can actively change this through diplomatic actions, event options, etcetera and it affects what actions you can take towards a country, whether AI or human.  </p>
<p>Attitude on the other hand is specifically about the AI and signals broadly how you might expect it to act towards you. It's based on a large number of factors, including Relations, but only impacts what decisions the AI makes in cases where it has a choice.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 20 DIPLOMATIC ACTIONS</font></p>
<p>​Hello and welcome to yet another Victoria 3 dev diary! Today we’ll be continuing to talk about Diplomacy, specifically on the topic of Diplomatic Actions, which are the means by which countries in Victoria 3 conduct diplomacy, build (or tear down) relations, and sign various kinds of agreements with each other.  </p>
<p>Diplomatic Actions and how they work should be pretty familiar to anyone who’s played pretty much any other Paradox Grand Strategy game. In short, a Diplomatic Action is a type of interaction that is carried out by one country towards another, and which sometimes (but not always) requires the agreement of the other party.  </p>
<p>As the exact requirements and effects of a Diplomatic Action are unique to each type of action, this Dev Diary will mostly just be going over which actions currently exist in the game, but before I get into that I want to briefly explain about the three distinct categories that all actions fall into and how they differ:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instant Actions:</strong> These are actions that are carried out immediately upon use and/or acceptance (if acceptance is needed). They do not cost any Influence capacity as they do not require maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Actions</strong>: These are unilateral actions that are carried out over time by one party towards the other, and can only be cancelled by the first party. They can have an Influence maintenance cost, in which case only the first party is the one to pay it.</li>
<li><strong>Pacts</strong>: These are bilateral actions that are carried out over time as an agreement between two parties. If there is a maintenance cost, both parties have to pay it unless the agreement has a clear senior and junior partner (such as Subject relationships). Both parties can break the pact off, though in some cases it may require the agreement of the other party.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A look at some of the actions and pacts available between two independent countries</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2320%20-%20Diplomatic%20Actions/dd20%201v2.png"><img alt="dd20 1v2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2320%20-%20Diplomatic%20Actions/dd20%201v2.png" title="dd20 1v2.png" /></a></p>

<p>​If you’re still a bit unclear on the difference between these three, don’t worry! It should hopefully become clearer once we start going into examples. So with no further ado, let’s talk about what actions there currently are available in the game. Please note that, as always, the game is still under active development so what’s in here may not exactly match what we have for release.  </p>
<p>Instant Actions (not necessarily an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expel Diplomats</strong>: This is an action that immediately lowers Relations with the target country, stops any ongoing attempt by them to Improve Relations with you, and blocks further Improve Relations attempts for a period of 5 years. Using Expel Diplomats also gives the acting country some Infamy, and prevents them from using Expel Diplomats on the same country for 5 years.</li>
<li><strong>Take on Debt</strong>: This is an action that allows one country to take on the debt of another in exchange for being owed an Obligation (more on this in later dev diaries).</li>
<li><strong>Redeem Obligation</strong>: This is an action that forgives an Obligation owed to the acting country in exchange for a large boost in Relations.</li>
<li><strong>Violate Sovereignty</strong>: This is an action that allows the acting country to violate the neutrality of another country through whom they need military access, creating a Diplomatic Incident and potentially bringing new countries into the conflict. We’ll go more into under what conditions you can use this and exactly how it works at a later time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Russia’s unexpected attempt to build stronger relations with the Ottomans is not being received well at the Sublime Porte</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Expel Diplomats When enacted: Ottoman Relations towards Russia deteriorates by 30 Ottoman Empire the diplomats of Russia, preventing all improving of relations for 5 years increased by 10.00 Cancel Confirm WIP expels Infamy</font></p>
<p>​Ongoing Actions (not necessarily an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve Relations</strong>: This is an ongoing action that slowly raises relations up to a maximum value of 50 (out of 100). Costs Influence to maintain, with the cost increasing if the target has a high Rank</li>
<li><strong>Damage Relations</strong>: This is an ongoing action that slowly lowers relations down to a minimum value of -50 (out of -100). Costs Influence to maintain, with the cost increasing if the target has a high Rank</li>
<li><strong>Bankroll</strong>: This is an ongoing action where one country pays a part of its monetary income to another each week as direct subsidies to their state treasury.</li>
</ul>
<p>*The contest between Siam and Dai Nam for control of Cambodia led to a longstanding regional rivalry that sparked several wars in the early 19th century  </p>

​Non-Subject Pacts (not necessarily an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alliance:</strong> This is a diplomatic pact that allows two countries to help each other when attacked in a Diplomatic Play, even if they do not have an Interest in the relevant area (more on this next week). Costs Influence to maintain, with the cost increasing if the other part has a high Rank.</li>
<li><strong>Customs Union</strong>: This is a diplomatic pact where there is a senior and a junior partner, and makes the junior partner part of the senior partner’s national market instead of having their own market. Costs Influence to maintain for the senior partner only, with the cost increasing if the other part has a high Rank.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Agreement</strong>: This is a diplomatic pact which gives both countries competitive advantages when establishing trade routes in the market of the other country. Costs Influence to maintain, with the cost increasing if the other part has a high Rank.</li>

<p>​  </p>
<p>Subject Pacts (not necessarily an exhaustive list):  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protectorate</strong>: This is a type of non-colonial subject relationship where the subject is very autonomous, the only restriction placed on them being that they are not able to have a fully independent foreign policy. Can be turned into a Puppet by their overlord through a Diplomatic Play.</li>
<li><strong>Puppet</strong>: This is a type of non-colonial subject relationship where the subject has no diplomatic autonomy, pays part of their income to their overlord and is part of the overlord’s national market. Can be annexed by their overlord through a Diplomatic Play.</li>
<li><strong>Dominion</strong>: This is a type of colonial subject relationship where the subject has extensive diplomatic autonomy and can have their own subjects, though they’re still required to be part of their overlord’s market. Can be turned into a Territory by their overlord through a Diplomatic Play.</li>
<li><strong>Territory</strong>: This is a type of colonial subject relationship where the subject has limited diplomatic autonomy, pays part of their income to their overlord and is part of the overlord’s national market. Can be annexed by their overlord through a Diplomatic Play.</li>
<li><strong>Tributary</strong>: This is a special subject relationship only available to Unrecognized Powers where the subject has extensive diplomatic autonomy and can have their own subjects, though they’re required to pay part of their income to their overlord. Can be turned into a Vassal by their overlord through a Diplomatic Play.</li>

<p>​Before I leave off, I also just want to briefly mention that as with many of our systems, the Diplomatic Action system is built to be completely moddable, up to and including adding new forms of Subjects or entirely new Pacts with completely custom effects. We’re quite excited to see how you all take advantage of all this moddability once the game is finally out!  </p>
<p>Well then, that’s it! This has of course been something of a brief overview, and we’ve left out a bunch of details regarding a number of the interactions that we’ll come back to later, but it should give you a good idea of the limits of diplomacy in Victoria 3… that is, unless you’re willing to get a bit more bold, in which case you should check back next week, as we talk about Diplomatic Plays and how they will let you shatter those limits!</p>

<p>If a country changes country type, its subjects are automatically converted to new appropriate types of subjects (so a vassal would become a territory for instance).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As there was no standardization of what different type of client states were called, we can't really map every type of subject name to every historical relationship. We chose to use Protectorate for the more generic subject type to due its widespread usage in the era.</p>

<p>I just realized that there is no Guarantee Independence diplomatic action like in EU4 which is... concerning. There are historical examples of this in the nineteenth century, most important being the guarantee of neutrality for Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. In fact, the guarantee of Belgian neutrality via Treaty of London, 1839, played an important role in Britain's entry into World War I, as it was a signatory to that treaty as did Prussia, whose successor state German Empire violated it in invasion of Belgium.  </p>
<p>Though, one issue with Guarantee Independence as a diplomatic action, as implemented in EU4, in application to treaties with respect to EU4 is that it could be easily revoked and almost instantly. I'm not sure if that would make any sense, though any countries could, by the nature of their own sovereignty, renounce or denounce a treaty that they had signed, though not always without consequences, especially the immediate kind.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the list here is not an exhaustive one and Guarantee Independence in some form on my todolist to implement, I'd just like to make sure that it's a little more than just something the guarantor can revoke at will though.</p>

<p>Subjects can start plays to get more autonomy or gain independence, and more autonomous subjects can even try to expand at the expense of other subjects of the same overlord (with the overlord able to take sides or stay out of it).</p>

<p>Will there be opportunities for Puppets to do diplomacy at least undercover? Modding aside, and I can see many opportunities to play around with those in regards to Ottoman and Russian subjects, I am curious as to how puppets would be able to handle diplomacy in Vanilla Vic3. Using an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/powderkeg-of-europe-balkans-megathread.1475715/">example from my Balkans thread and Serbia</a>  </p>
<p>which did unofficial diplomacy through the foreign consulates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subjects, including Puppets, have their own Influence which they can start their own Pacts with, manipulate Relations, etcetera. The precise nature of their subject relationship might block some of these interactions but generally the approach we've taken is to make subject nations as autonomously playable as possible without making your subjects too annoying when you're playing as the overlord. The rule of thumb is we want entering into (or being forced into) a subject relationship with a higher-ranking country to be a strategic medium-term choice rather than a death sentence.</p>

<p>If you can have a puppet give income, can it give other resources (i.e., prestige, "research"?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the tribute some subjects must pay, subject nations also confer a portion of their Prestige onto their overlord. Since they also tend to be in their overlord's market they also supply goods, add to demand, provide a semi-mobile workforce, etcetera. There's currently no other transfers of resources planned but the scriptable Pact system makes it very easy to add, so not saying it's impossible.</p>

<p>Personal Union is also a type of relatively autonomous "legacy" subject. Some PUs exist at start of game but you can't make new ones.</p>

<p>​It’s Thursday again and you know what that means - another Diplomacy dev diary! Today’s dev diary is one I’ve been looking forward to writing for some time, as it covers Diplomatic Plays, which we consider to be more or less <strong>the</strong> signature feature for Diplomacy in Victoria 3.  </p>
<p>So what are Diplomatic Plays? Well, to answer that question, I’m going to reach all the way back to <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-0.1475078/">Dev Diary #0</a> and one of the four game design pillars, namely Diplomatic Eminence. That pillar reads as follows: War is a continuation of diplomacy, and everything that is achievable by war should also be achievable through diplomacy (even if that diplomacy sometimes comes at the point of a gun).   </p>
<p>Well, diplomacy at the point of a gun is exactly what Diplomatic Plays are, as they allow you to try to achieve any objective normally achievable by war by diplomatically maneuvering to force the other side to give it to you without a fight. To fully explain what I mean by that, we’ll go over the mechanics of Diplomatic Plays in sequence - how they start, how they play out, and finally how they are resolved.  </p>
<p>The way Diplomatic Plays start is the way you would normally start a war in another Paradox Grand Strategy Game - by demanding something from another country, for example that they cede a particular state to you. In fact, unlike other GSGs, Victoria 3 has no ‘declare war’ button to get what you demand - instead you start a Diplomatic Play, and wars are always preceded by Diplomatic Plays.  </p>
<p><em>The fourteen opening moves currently available as Diplomatic Plays, each corresponding with a war goal. As usual, the number in green indicates the number of possible valid targets that exist for that Play.</em>  </p>

<p>​Once a Diplomatic Play is started, there’s a number of things that happen immediately. First, the country that is being targeted is of course notified, along with any countries that are considered <em>Potential Participants</em> in the play. Who is considered a potential participant depends on the exact nature of the play, but usually it includes any country with an Interest in the Strategic Region where the Play is taking place as well as countries that have a strong diplomatic reason to get involved (such as allies or the overlord of the defender). At this point it’s important to note that <em>only</em> the Initiator (the country starting the play) and Target (the country targeted) are active participants, all others just have the potential to take part.  </p>
<p>Next, the primary active participants on each side (the Initiator and the Target initially, though this can change if the overlord of either side steps into the play) are given a number of Maneuvers. This is a currency that primarily depends on Rank, with higher Rank countries having more maneuvers, and determines how many actions such as Swaying and adding Demands (more on these below) that said primary participant can take during the course of the play to try and gain the advantage over their enemy.  </p>
<p>There are three distinct phases over which a Diplomatic Play plays, based on the level of Escalation, which is a value that increases each day after the play is started. The first of these is <em>Opening Moves</em>, during which participating countries take stock of the situation, set their initial stances (more on that below) and the Target has time to set their Main Demand (the Main Demand of the Initiator has already been set, as it depends on what type of Play was started). During the Opening Moves phase, it isn’t possible for other countries to fully commit to one side or another, with the sole exception of overlords of the primary participants. It also isn’t possible for either side to back down.  </p>
<p><em>Cape Colony’s bid for independence and open British markets turned out to be a step too far. Britain demands nothing less than total annexation of the colonial upstarts, whose only hope now is either suffering partial annexation for its insolence, or having to get in real close with France and hope for the best.</em>  </p>

<p>​Once Escalation reaches a certain point, the Opening Moves phase ends and the <em>Diplomatic Maneuvering</em> phase starts. If by this point the Target has not set their Main Demand, they are automatically given one (usually War Reparations). This is the ‘main’ phase of the Diplomatic Play, which occupies the majority of the escalation scale and during which most of the ‘action’ takes place.   </p>
<p>During this phase, potential participants can now set any stance towards each side, from full support without requiring anything in return (something most AIs won’t be keen to do as they’re not big on having their troops die for charity, at least not in an offensive war), to leaning towards a particular side (which will signal to that side that they’re likely willing to be swayed), to simply being on the fence with no particular preference for either side. It’s also possible for countries that have not committed to one side or the other to simply Declare Neutrality and exit the play altogether, though this might have diplomatic consequences depending on the circumstances.  </p>
<p><em>With only a fraction of the military strength of Great Qing, Kokand’s future independence looks highly questionable. But this Play still has the potential to become pretty complex if Kokand can convince the Sikh and Russian empires to support their case against Qing.

<p>​The Diplomatic Maneuvering phase is also when the primary participants are expected to use up their available Maneuvers on adding Demands and Swaying potential participants to their side. It is also possible to spend your Maneuvers during the Opening Moves phase on adding Demands for yourself, burning through most of them early might leave you at a significant disadvantage late.   </p>
<p>Demands are essentially Wargoals (and will turn into such if the Play escalates into war, but more on that later) and includes a wide variety of requests-under-duress such as ceding land, giving up claims or becoming a subject. Only the primary participants can add Demands, but in addition to demanding things on their own behalf they can also demand things on behalf of other countries backing them, if said country agrees that the Demand is something they want.  </p>
<p>While this may make it sound like it’s a good idea to spend your maneuvers piling on as many Demands for yourself as possible, there’s a couple reasons not to. First, adding certain aggressive Demands (such as demanding land) always results in a Diplomatic Incident, which will immediately give you <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-19-relations-and-infamy.1494496/">Infamy</a> and may degrade relations with countries you need to support you in the Play. Second, being seen as greedy and unreasonable in your Demands will in itself make it harder to get countries to back you up, and may in fact make it so undecided participants side against you just to put a stop to your mad dreams of conquest. It’s worth noting though, that the Infamy from any Demands or Wargoals that end up not being pressed (for any reason) is partially or fully refunded, though their negative impact on relations remain.  </p>
<p>Swaying, on the other hand, is the main way in which the primary participants get undecided participants over to their side, by making them a promise. This promise may be in the form of owing them an Obligation (more on this in a later dev diary) or promising them a Wargoal if the Play escalates into war. There’s a few more such types of promises planned for release (promising to become their Protectorate or giving them a piece of land or a subject of yours, for example) but these are not yet implemented. If the country agrees, they will be set as backing the Swaying side in the Diplomatic Play, and will fight on their side if war breaks out, just as if they voluntarily set their stance to backing that side.  </p>
<p><em>Offering Prussia the Austrian states of West Galicia, Moravia, or Bohemia would be most appreciated, as they are populous border states. States which do not already border Prussian land are less attractive to them as they would be much harder to manage.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2321%20-%20Diplomatic%20Plays/DD21%204v1.png"><img alt="DD21 4v1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2321%20-%20Diplomatic%20Plays/DD21%204v1.png" title="DD21 4v1.png" /></a></p>

<p>​However, if you think the Play is over just because France threw their weight behind the Initiator and there isn’t anyone strong enough to oppose them, you’d be wrong! It’s possible for countries that have promised to back a side to betray that promise and go back to being undecided, or even switch sides entirely, perhaps because the other side made an even juicier offer. Doing this of course makes them lose out on anything that was promised to them and negatively impacts on relations with the betrayed side, but otherwise there is no limit to how many times a single country can switch sides in a Diplomatic Play (the AI will be rather reluctant to offer something to a country that has already forsaken them once unless they desperately need their support, though).   </p>
<p>This also means that trying to ‘play it smart’ by burning through your maneuvers immediately to sway all the countries you think you need early in the Play can backfire, as the other side is then free to try and ‘bid over’ on your supporters while you’re unable to do anything. Furthermore, it can also make it risky to not be upfront about your own territorial demands - doing the swaying first and then saying ‘oh, and by the way, I want London’ might result in your side of the Play looking very empty all of a sudden as your former supporters scramble to distance themselves from you. Swaying and adding Demands during Diplomatic Maneuvering will also both pause Escalation for some time when carried out, to make it possible for the other side to react even if those actions are taken right at the end of the phase.  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Peru abandoned Bolivia Feb 1 Peru abandoned their support for Bolivia in the Diplomatic Play Ecuador: WIP against</font></p>
<p>​The final phase of the Diplomatic Play is <em>Countdown to War</em>, which is exactly what it says on the tin. During Countdown to War, both sides are locked down and it’s no longer possible for countries to declare or abandon support for either side, nor is it possible to add new Demands or do any Swaying. In fact, the only thing that is possible during this phase is Backing Down, and this is usually the phase when you will see one of the sides give in (though it is also possible to back down during Diplomatic Maneuvering).  </p>
<p>Backing Down is, quite simply, one side deciding that the odds aren’t looking in their favor and deciding to concede the Main Demand of the other side to cut their losses. It’s important to note that <em>only</em> the Main Demand is ever conceded in this way, so any additional Demands that are either added or promised to supporters of the winning side are simply lost (with accrued Infamy fully refunded), along with of course all the Demands on the losing side. This means that there is actually in some cases a reason to want the Play to escalate into war (and hence, to not stack the odds in such a way that the other side sees no path to victory), as it is the only way in which you can simultaneously press multiple Demands/Wargoals, assuming you’re willing (or at least <em>think you’re willing</em>) to bear the heavy cost of the war. It’s possible to back down all the way up until the Escalation meter hits 100, at which point the Diplomatic Play is over and War breaks out.  </p>
<p><em>Once all the cards are on the table you have to carefully weigh if this is really something you’re able to win, and what cost you’re willing to pay for the opportunity to try. Perhaps it’s better to cut your losses, gain a Truce, let the other side accrue some Infamy, score a Claim on the lost territory (if the Play was about land), and start making a plan to recover what you lost - and then some.</em>  </p>

<p>​Whew, that was a lot of text, and I’m sure I’ve still missed some detail or another. As those of you who are familiar with Victoria 2 has noticed, Diplomatic Plays draws a lot of inspiration from the Crisis feature in Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness, a feature I’ve personally worked on and always thought was one of the most interesting things we’ve done in any expansion for a Paradox GSG. But with that said, our dev diaries on Diplomacy are drawing to a close (for now, we’ll certainly return to the subject later) as next week we’re going to talk about something you’ve been (rightfully) curious about since the announcement… War!</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 22 THE CONCEPT OF WAR</font></p>
<p>​Hello and welcome to another Victoria 3 development diary! Today’s dev diary has been a hotly anticipated one, as we’re finally ready to start talking about war and combat and how they will work in Victoria 3.   </p>
<p>So then, how does war and combat work? The answer is that we’ve taken a pretty different approach to warfare and combat in Victoria 3 compared to other Paradox Grand Strategy Games, and in this dev diary I’ll be going over the overall vision that governs our design for warfare, with the actual nitty-gritty on the mechanics coming over the next few weeks. Just as Victoria 3 itself has a set of design pillars that all game mechanics follow (as outlined in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-0.1475078/">very first diary</a>), Warfare in Victoria 3 has its own design pillars, which we will now explain in turn.  </p>
<p>The first pillar is one that is shared with the vision of the game as a whole: <strong>War is a Continuation of Diplomacy</strong> - anything you can gain through war should also be possible to gain through diplomacy. As we’ve already talked about this multiple times in the past, and last week’s dev diary told you all about Diplomatic Plays, we don’t feel the need to go into this again, but it’s still important to keep in mind to understand our approach to warfare.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-1.png"><img alt="dd22-1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-1.png" title="dd22-1.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: CONCEPT ART</font></p>
<p>​The second pillar, <strong>War is Strategic</strong>, is exactly what it sounds like. In Victoria 3, all decisions you make regarding warfare are on the strategic level, not the tactical. What this means is that you do not move units directly on the map, or make decisions about which exact units should be initiating battle where. Instead of being unit-in-province-based, warfare in Victoria 3 is focused on supplying and allocating troops to frontlines between you and your enemies. The decisions you make during war are about matters such as what front you send your generals to and what overall strategy they should be following there. If this sounds like a radical departure from the norm in Paradox GSGs, that’s because it is, and I’ll be talking more about the rationale at the end of this dev diary.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-2.png"><img alt="dd22-2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-2.png" title="dd22-2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: CONCEPT ART</font></p>
<p>The third pillar, <strong>War is Costly</strong>, is all about the cost of war - political, economic and humanitarian. There is no such thing as a bloodless war in Victoria 3, as just the act of mobilizing your army will immediately start accruing casualties from accident and disease (as these were and remain the biggest killers of men during war, not battles) in addition to being an immense financial burden for your country. The soldiers and conscripts who die during war leave behind children and widows, and may even become dependents themselves as a result of injuries sustained during your quest for national glory.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-3.png"><img alt="dd22-3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-3.png" title="dd22-3.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: CONCEPT ART</font></p>
<p>The fourth pillar, <strong>Preparation is Key</strong>, ties heavily into the second and third pillars. Much of the strategic decision making in Victoria 3 that will let you win wars are all about how well prepared you are. For example: Have you promoted the most competent generals, or were you forced to promote an incompetent wastrel for political expedience? Have you invested in the best (but very costly) rifles for your soldiers, or are you forced to fight at a technological disadvantage? During the Diplomatic Play preceding the war, did you mobilize all your armies in time and eat the costs in men and materiel, or did you hold off hoping on a peaceful resolution, or at least for the conflict to end up as a limited war? Did you choose to build and subsidize an arms industry large enough to cover your wartime needs, or is your army reliant on import of weapons that may be vulnerable to enemy shipping disruptions? These are the sort of questions that can decide who has the true advantage when going into an armed conflict in Victoria 3.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-4.png"><img alt="dd22-4.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-4.png" title="dd22-4.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: CONCEPT ART</font></p>
<p>The fifth pillar, <strong>Navies Matter</strong>, is an ambition of ours that for many countries, navies should feel just as important (and in some cases more important) as armies. In addition to supporting or hindering overseas expeditions (by, for example, cutting off enemy supply lines), navies play a crucial role in waging economic warfare, as a country whose economy (or even worse, military goods supply) depends on trade will be vulnerable to the actions of hostile navies.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-5.png"><img alt="dd22-5.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-5.png" title="dd22-5.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: CONCEPT ART</font></p>
<p>The sixth and final pillar, <strong>War Changes</strong>, is all about the technological advances of the 19th century and the way that warfare changed from the maneuvering of post-napoleonic armies to the meat grinder that was World War One. Our ambition is for these changes to be felt in the gameplay of Victoria 3, as technologies such as the machine gun makes warfare an ever bloodier and costlier affair while advancements in naval technology makes it easier for countries with advanced navies to project global power.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-6.png"><img alt="dd22-6.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2322%20-%20The%20Concept%20of%20War/dd22-6.png" title="dd22-6.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: CONCEPT ART</font></p>
<p>Before I end this dev diary, I want to talk briefly about our most radical departure from other Paradox GSGs - the absence of units you move on the map, and why we chose to go in this direction. The main reason is simply that Victoria 3 is a game primarily focused on Economy, Diplomacy and Politics and we felt a more strategic approach to warfare mechanics fits the game better than micro-intensive tactical maneuvering.   </p>
<p>It’s important to note that how this works differs completely from having AI-controlled units in our other GSGs, since in Victoria 3 armies you assign armies to fronts rather than provinces (navies of course work differently, but more on that later). We’ll be getting into the exact details of the mechanics for both armies and navies in the coming weeks.  </p>
<p>We of course still want Victoria 3 to have interesting and meaningful warfare mechanics, but we want the player to be engaging on a higher level of decision-making, making decisions about the overall war strategy and just how much they’re willing to sacrifice to achieve their goals rather than deciding which exact battalions should be battling it out in which exact province next.   </p>
<p>This also ties into the general costliness of wars and the fact that you can achieve your ends through diplomacy - we want the ways in which an outmatched Victoria 3 player triumphs over their enemies to be clever diplomacy, well-planned logistics and rational strategic thinking rather than brilliant generalship. Ultimately, we’ve taken this approach to warfare for the same reason we take any game design decision: because we believe that it will make Victoria 3 a better game.  </p>
<p>With that said, we’re done for today! We’ll of course be talking much more about warfare in the coming weeks, starting with next week’s dev diary on the topic of <strong>Fronts and Generals</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>An important thing to note that in Victoria 3, the warfare system isn't built around an AI having to control the sort of tactical moment-to-moment decisions you'd normally be doing as a player, so it isn't just units on the map with the AI maneuvering around and potentially making foolish decisions - everything is built from the ground up towards a more strategic form of warfare, where the blunders and moments of brilliance are strategic rather than tactical. You still have a considerable degree of agency in the outcome of your wars, it's just that the decisions you make are different than in our other games.</p>

<p>The next dev diaries will be going into detail on the mechanics of warfare, yes. For this one, we wanted to focus on the overall vision to explain our reasoning behind the departure from how warfare works in our other games.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 23 FRONTS ( GENERALS</font></p>
<p>​Hello and welcome! Today we will dig into the core mechanics of land warfare, including Fronts, Generals, Battalions, Mobilization, and more. But let’s take a moment first to recall the pillars of warfare in Victoria 3 from <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-22-the-concept-of-war.1496459/">last week’s diary</a>, which should be considered prerequisite reading to this one.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>War is a Continuation of Diplomacy</strong></li>
<li><strong>War is Strategic</strong></li>
<li><strong>War is Costly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Preparation is Key</strong></li>
<li><strong>Navies Matter</strong></li>
<li><strong>War Changes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get started I want to point out that a few of the mechanics I will be mentioning below are currently still under implementation in the current build. While development diary screenshots should never be taken as fully representative of the final product, this is especially true in this case. In some cases images will be artistic mockups and visual targets, and in other cases very rough in-game screenshots that will be revised before release. The reason for this is simply because, as we have stressed previously in these dev diaries, Victoria 3 is a game about economics, politics, and diplomacy first and foremost. War is a very important supporting system to all those three which tie them together, but we needed to make sure those three aspects were mature enough before we put the final touches on the military system. Furthermore, being a drastic divergence from how warfare works in all other Paradox games, these systems have required a lot of time in the oven to feel as fully baked as the others. Once we are closer to release we’ll make sure to update you on any revisions, and release more finalized in-game screenshots!  </p>
<p>First I want to present the concept of <strong>Fronts</strong>. In Victoria 3, rather than manually moving armies around the map, you assign troops (via Generals, as we will see later) to the border provinces where two combatants clash. All combat takes place on these Fronts, where a victorious outcome consists of moving the Front into your enemy’s territory while preventing incursions into your own.  </p>
<p>Fronts are created automatically as soon as two countries begin to oppose each other in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-21-diplomatic-plays.1495892/">Diplomatic Play</a>, and consist of all provinces along the border of control between those two countries. Therefore a Front always has one country on either side, <em>but</em> it is possible for Generals from several countries to be assigned to the same Front.  </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a screenshot from the current build of the game:  </p>
<p><em>An early draft view of the Texas Utah Front. This Front belongs to the Texan Revolutionary War of 1835, which is in full swing on the game’s start date. Two Texan Generals are assigned to this Front, Samuel Houston with an Advance Order and William Travis with a Defense Order. On Mexico’s side, José de Romay is advancing with 10 Battalions. The four stars on either side indicates relative average fighting skill compared to the world’s best - here Mexico and Texas are tied with 40 Offense and 35 Defense each. From Mexico’s perspective this Front has a slight advantage at the moment and indeed one battle on this Front has already been won by them.</em>  </p>

<p>​As mentioned at the top, these visuals - and all other images in this diary - are far from complete! We have many parameters left to expose, more UI layout to do, and more visual effects to add before release. Everything you are seeing today is only to give you a better idea of the mechanics, but is in heavy revision as we speak and will look different on release. As such it is not to be taken as representative of what you will see in the final product.  </p>
<p>The health and status of your Fronts is a primary indicator of how well the war is going for you. Do you have more troops on the Front than your enemy does? That’s pretty good. Have you advanced it far into enemy territory? Great. Are your soldiers there demoralized and dying in droves from attrition? Double-plus ungood.  </p>
<p>In a large end-game conflict you might have hundreds of thousands - possibly even <em>millions</em> - of soldiers in active service, which is a lot to keep track of. The number of active Fronts, however, is likely to be much more manageable. The design philosophy here is the same as with the economic Pop model. Our aim is to make the game playable and well-paced, without requiring frequent pausing, on every scale while retaining the detail and integrity of the Pop simulation. For warfare, the scale ranges from a small border skirmish between minor nations in single-player to a massive multiplayer world war involving every Great Power. Using the Front system we can account for every individual Serviceman and Officer in meticulous detail while giving the player a high-level strategic interface to monitor and manipulate. Much like with the economic interface of Buildings or the political interface of Interest Groups, from this Front view you can drill down through your Generals all the way to the individual Pops that actually do the fighting if you want to.  </p>
<p><em>After a particularly punishing battle the Texan Barracks are desperately trying to recruit replacements to send to the front.</em>  </p>

<p>​<strong>Generals</strong> are characters who command Servicemen and Officers into battle on Fronts. Every country will start the game with one or a few Generals - many of them straight out of the history books - and can recruit more as needed.  </p>
<p>Generals are recruited from <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-21-diplomatic-plays.1495892/">Strategic Regions</a>, and gain command of as many locally available troops in that region that their <strong>Command Limit</strong> allows. Command Limit is determined by their Rank, which ranges from 1-star to 5-star. If several Generals are headquartered in the same Strategic Region, the troops are split up between them proportional to their Command Limit as well. Military operations can be complex to manage, and to model this every General costs a certain amount of Bureaucracy to maintain. You can promote Generals freely, but while higher-ranking Generals can effectively command more troops they also cost more Bureaucracy.  </p>
<p>Like other characters, such as Heads of States and Interest Group Leaders, Generals have a set of <strong>Traits</strong> that determine their abilities and weaknesses. Admirals, their naval counterparts, work the same way. These Traits determine everything about how the characters function and what bonuses and penalties they confer onto their troops, their Front, and the battles they participate in.  </p>
<p>All characters have a <em>Personality Trait</em>, with different effects depending on what role they fill. For example, a <em>Cruel General</em> might cause more deaths among enemy casualties, leaving fewer enemy Pops to recover through battlefield medicine or return home as Dependents, while a <em>Charismatic General</em> might keep their troops’ Morale high even when supplies run short.  </p>
<p>Characters can also gain <em>Skill</em> Traits which are unique to their role. Generals may develop skills like <em>Woodland Terrain Expert</em> that increases their troops’ efficiency when fighting in Forest or Jungle, or <em>Engineer</em> that increases their troops’ Defense. Freshly recruited Generals start with one of these but can gain more as they age and gain experience. Many Skill traits have several tiers as well, so Generals that remain active across many campaigns may deepen their abilities over time.  </p>
<p>Characters may also gain <em>Conditions</em> due to events or simply the passage of time. These often affect the character’s health, but might also influence their popularity or ability to carry out their basic duties. <em>Shellshocked</em> is a classic example of a Condition your General might gain.  </p>
<p><em>This fellow (whose full name I refuse to write out) has a Direct personality, prefers to command troops in Open Terrain, and is an expert Surveyor of the battlefield. He’s also become Wounded, probably as a result of some recent skirmish.</em>  </p>

<p>​Like all characters, Generals and Admirals are also aligned with an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Interest Group</a> - which is often, but not always, the Armed Forces. For Heads of States and Interest Group Leaders the impact of this political allegiance is obvious, but why (you may ask) would this matter for Generals and Admirals?  </p>
<p>In addition to industrialization and revolutions, the 19th Century was also known for its revolving door between military and political office. Often given assignments far from the capital with very limited communications, Generals and Admirals were given access to enormous man- and firepower and sent off with little possibility of oversight to see to the nation’s best interests. This autonomy not only granted them considerable geopolitical power while in the field, but also made them extremely popular figures once returning home from a successful campaign. As such, in Victoria 3 your decisions on who to recruit, promote, and retire - which should ideally be based on meritocratic concerns - sometimes have to be tempered also by concerns for internal power balance and stability due to the impact Generals can have on the country’s Interest Groups.  </p>
<p>First off, the character contributes directly to their Interest Group’s Political Strength, which as we know determines their Clout. The amount provided is dependent on their rank, so granting a promotion to a promising young General will also increase the influence their Interest Group wields.  </p>
<p>Second, if a General is becoming a little too big for their boots - or perhaps crippled by adverse Conditions, like that 79-year old fossil who <em>just won’t leave active service</em> despite senility and various ailments - and you want to force them into retirement so someone else can take command of their troops, their Interest Group’s Approval will be impacted. Understandably so, since you just robbed them of some political power!  </p>
<p>Third, and most important, if an Interest Group becomes <em>revolutionary</em> - which will be the subject of another dev diary - their Generals and Admirals will take up against you. If you’ve put all your eggs in the basket of some farmer’s boy who turned out to be a strategic genius and you suffer an agrarian uprising, you may end up fighting a rebellion against that same brilliant commander using fresh recruits still wet behind the ears.  </p>
<p><em>Commanders can also be the focal points of special events, caused either of their own volition or by a situation you have put them in. Your decisions in these events may end up affecting your country in any number of ways.</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: A Question of Influence Event in Ingria General Matvey Khrapovitsky has offered to increase the approval of the Armed Forces, for a small increase in their budget. "Let me talk with them; Ihave some influcnce: few friendly words here and there, could make all the difference: Of course all this travcling would cost mc quitc = bit: Raise the budget. Don' raise the budget. WIP help</font></p>
<p>​Both Generals and Admirals can be given <strong>Orders</strong> which they are obliged to try to carry out. We will go over Admiral Orders next week. The Orders you can give Generals are quite straightforward:  </p>
<p><strong>Stand By</strong>: the General returns home from their current Front, dispersing their troops into their home region’s Garrison forces to slow down any enemy incursions  </p>
<p><strong>Advance Front</strong>: the General gathers their troops, moves to the target Front, and tries to advance it by launching attacks at the enemy  </p>
<p><strong>Defend Front</strong>: like Advance Front except the General never advances, instead focusing only on intercepting and repelling enemy forces  </p>
<p>These orders may end up executed in different ways depending on the General’s Traits, resulting in different troop compositions and battle conditions during the operations. For example, a Reckless General may provide his Battalions with increased Offense during advances, but fewer of his casualties taken will recover after the battle. Further, his recklessness may lead to making a Risky Maneuver during a battle, which could prove a brilliant or catastrophic move. If you want to play it safer you could assign a Cautious but well-supplied General to a frontline, even though that may be less prestigious.  </p>
<p>Generals charged with advancing a Front will favor marching towards and conquering states marked as war goals, but their route there may be more or less circuitous depending on how the war is progressing and possibly other factors such as the local terrain. Other such designated priority targets, which the player could set themselves to alter the flow of battle, is a feature we’re looking into adding to represent strategies and events such as General Sherman’s march to the sea. This is not currently in the game but is something we think would add an interesting dimension to the strategic gameplay, so something like this is likely to make its way in sooner or later!  </p>
<p>Fronts targeted to Advance or Defend can also be a Front belonging to a co-belligerent, as long as you can reach it by land or sea. For example, if Prussia supports Finland in a war of independence against Russia, they could send one or two Generals to advance their own Front against Russia and another to help defend the Finnish-Russian Front, ensuring Finland can stay in the war for as long as possible while simultaneously striking at Russia’s own war support. To do so it needs to send its troops helping Finland across the Baltic, which require naval support we will learn more about next week.  </p>
<p>Generals cannot be given Orders unless they are <strong>Mobilizing</strong>. In peacetime, all Generals will be demobilized, doing whatever it is 19th Century Generals do in peacetime (probably drink copious amounts of wine, have sordid affairs, and plot against their governments) while their troops are on standby doing occasional drills to keep readiness up. As soon as a Diplomatic Play starts, and for as long as the country is at war after that, players have the option to Mobilize any and all of their Generals, which will increase the consumption of military buildings (guns, ammo, artillery, etc) and start the process of getting that General’s troops ready for frontline action. The speed by which troops are readied is dependent on the Infrastructure in their local state, so high-infrastructure states can mobilize many more troops quickly while low-infrastructure, rural states might take much longer to gather and organize a lot of manpower.  </p>
<p>This means <em>when</em> you choose to start mobilizing, and <em>how many</em> Generals and Battalions you choose to mobilize, will matter a lot to your initial success in the war - and as everyone knows, the first few battles could well prove decisive if the other party is taken by surprise. The magnitude of mobilization becomes immediately visible to the other participants in a Diplomatic Play as soon as the decision is taken. Choosing to mobilize big and early in a Diplomatic Play tells the other participants two things: one, you’re serious, and two, you’re hedging your bets that this won’t end peacefully. This in turn can trigger a cascade of mobilizations, and before you know it, a peaceful solution is no longer on the table. Choosing to hold off on mobilization until late means you save precious money and lives until it’s needed, but may cost you the war if that’s what it comes down to.  </p>
<p>Mobilized Generals cannot be demobilized until the war is over. Once you’ve committed your troops to the war, they expect to be in the field and well-supplied until a peace is signed. If getting what you want out of a war takes a long time, your expenses may eventually begin to exceed the value of the potential prize.  </p>

<p>​Your land army is composed of <strong>Battalions</strong>, which are groups of 1000 Workforce with Servicemen or Officer Professions. Like all other Pops these work in Buildings, in this case either <em>Barracks</em> or <em>Conscription Centers</em>. The difference between these are that Barracks are constructed manually and house the country’s standing army, which are considered permanent troops, while Conscription Centers are activated as-needed during a Diplomatic Play or War and recruit civilians into temporary military service. In addition Barracks have a wider selection of Production Methods to choose from, particularly high-tech late-game Production Methods. How your army is divided between professional and conscripted soldiers depends on your Army Model Law, which we will cover in more detail in a few weeks.  </p>
<p>The Production Methods in these two buildings work like other Production Methods do: they employ Pops of certain Professions, and consume goods to provide a set of effects. In this case they employ Servicemen and Officers in proportions depending on your organization style, consume a number of military goods, and in return provide Battalions with different combat statistics such as Offense (indicating how useful they are during an advance) and Defense (indicating how useful they are when defending against an advance).  </p>
<p>Since military buildings work according to the same logic as other buildings, such as factories and plantations, all core mechanics such as Market Access, Goods Shortages, Qualifications, etcetera apply to them in exactly the same way. If one of your Barracks’ Battalions are supported by Armored Divisions but you cannot supply it with enough Tanks, recruitment will slow down to painful levels and both Offense and Defense will suffer. If you don’t have enough qualifying Officers the number of Battalions the building can actually create will be throttled. Just because you have researched a new type of artillery piece or a more efficient way of organizing your army doesn’t mean you’ll be ready to modernize straight away, and if your local infrastructure suffers the acquisition cost for the requisite goods could reach astronomical levels.  </p>
<p>Upgrades to Production Methods in military buildings take considerable time to take effect. While any goods consumption changes happen immediately, improvements to combat effectiveness takes some time to realize. Keeping military spending low during peacetime by reverting your military to pre-Napoleonic warfare doctrines might be pleasant for your treasury but less great for both your war readiness and Prestige, the latter which is directly impacted both by how large and how advanced your army is.  </p>

Illustrations are selected for a collection of similar Battalions based on dominant Battalion culture (defined by the Pops in the military building) and tech level (defined by the Production Methods in use in the military building).

<p>​All this leads us to <strong>Battles</strong>. Advancing Generals will eventually gather enough troops to launch an attack into one of the enemy-controlled provinces along the Front, which will be intercepted by defending troops and possibly an enemy General. In short, a battle then takes place over some number of days until one force has taken enough casualties and morale damage to retreat. We will go over in more detail how battles play out in a future diary, but suffice to say for now that a bunch of Battalions go in along with a number of different combat-related stats and conditions, some of them related to the General and their troops, others due to conditions like province terrain and chance. If the advancing side wins, they capture a number of provinces depending on how large their win was, what sort of technology they use, how dispersed or concentrated the enemy forces are across the region, and so on. If the defending side wins, they repel the advancers and will likely be able to launch their counter-attack at a nice advantage.  </p>
<p>An item of note here is that just because one General might command 100 Battalions while the other side’s General might only command 20 does not mean every battle outcome on this Front is predetermined. A single Front can cover a large stretch of land and just because a General with 100 Battalions is “on a Front” does not mean they travel with 100,000 individuals in their encampment; those Battalions are considered to be spread out, simultaneously planning their next advance while intercepting enemy advances, and as such the force size each side in the battle can bring to bear may vary. Furthermore, Battalions under the command of other friendly Generals on the same Front may be temporarily borrowed for a certain battle, and even Battalions without mobilized Generals (considered part of the region’s Garrison) can be used to defend against incursions. However, Battalions not under the direct command of the General in charge of the battle do not gain the benefit of his Traits.  </p>
<p>This variable sizing of battles, particularly when combined with mobilization costs, counteracts the otherwise dominant strategy of “doomstacking” and make wars feel more like a tug-of-war than a race. Each side can choose to either try to gain marginal advantage over the other on the cheap, or spare no expense to increase their chances for an expedient victory, with any position on this spectrum being a valid option in different situations.  </p>
<p>We’ll get deeper into some of the combat statistics that go into resolving a battle in a few weeks when we explore military buildings in more detail, and we will talk more about how Battles play out and look on the map in a diary a little further down the line. We’re anxious to show them to you, but need to give these visuals a little more attention first!  </p>
<p>That’s land warfare in a nutshell. In the two upcoming dev diaries we will go over the major role that navies play in this system as well as the economic and human costs of war, which are closely interrelated. For now I want to close by saying that we appreciate your patience in waiting for details on warfare mechanics! The reasons for why we’ve chosen to diverge so far from the classic GSG military formula would be hard to grasp until you’ve seen how the different economic, political, and diplomatic systems function.  </p>
<p>Next week we will talk more about warfare mechanics as we get into how your navy plays into all this. Until then!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's weight-based, not deterministic. But in this case there's a high chance that the battle will take place in <em>either</em> mountain <em>or</em> forest compared to other terrain - because the advancing party will want to fight in mountain, while the defending party will want to fight in forest, so both will try to arrange for the battle to transpire in "their" province.  </p>
<p>An important mindset shift here is that it's not that one army is trying to seek out another army to do battle, but rather that the advancing army is trying to capture territory - preferably <em>without</em> a fight, or fighting as small a number as possible - while the defending army is trying to <em>stop</em> that with as large a force as possible. This is a bit different from other PDS games where you usually try to make your stack chase down an enemy stack, with sieging provinces being something you only do after the enemy stack is defeated and before they come back with a larger force.</p>

<p>Rehoming Generals between Strategic Regions is not part of the system as this would be too fiddly and introduce some unfortunate exploits. However, getting this option as a one-time thing to deal with a problematic General would be a very cool event! I'll ping the appropriate people. Big Grin    :D</p>

<p>This seems very flawed. It makes total sense for factories, and even some sense for administrative buildings, but military deployment doesn't work like that at all.

<p>You can build Barracks in Yorkshire, recruit your lads, and send your Yorkshire lads to Singapore when there's trouble brewing there if you like.  </p>
<p>You can also raise conscripts in Yorkshire and ship 'em out as you need them.  </p>
<p>But we're not talking about sending an army for temporary deployment overseas here. If you want a <em>military base</em> in Singapore, that houses, trains, and equips your troops, serves as a military logistics center, and supports their families for multiple generations - your ability to operate it will depend on the local market access, infrastructure, population etc. in <em>Singapore</em>. You can encourage Pops to move there from other parts of your country, certainly, but that's a separate mechanic.</p>

<p>The Barracks in Yorkshire is still considered their logistics center, so the troops now in Singapore must be supplied via an overseas route (more on that next week) from the Barracks in Yorkshire that handles all their acquisitions.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Arbriz Luarda 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 24 NAVIES &amp; ADMIRALS</font></p>
<p>​Happy Thursday and welcome back to our series of development diaries on warfare in Victoria 3! Today we talk about navies, and how we intend to make them as strategically important to winning wars as they were in history. This diary builds on the warfare vision presented in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-22-the-concept-of-war.1496459/">The Concept of War</a> and many of the core mechanics presented in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-23-fronts-and-generals.1497106/">Fronts and Generals</a>, so ensure those are fresh in your mind before reading on!  </p>
<p>Your ability to sustain an empire depends, to a large extent, on how well you can compete on the high seas. This is the era of truly global trade, which also meant countries were highly susceptible to disruption of that trade - and the higher they climb, the harder they may fall. In Victoria 3, maintaining a powerful blue-water navy is a large but necessary expense if you wish to ensure the integrity of your markets, overseas colonies, and trade routes during war. And even while at peace, a magnificent fleet can provide your nation with substantial Prestige!  </p>
<p>Our design intent for naval gameplay in Victoria 3 is that it should serve as a strategic precision instrument in conflicts between seafaring nations. The sea is not another “front” in a war. The province-based moving Front system works well to represent conflicts over territory but would be nonsensical at sea, where no nation can be said to meaningfully “control” an enormous stretch of ocean. Instead, Admirals and their Flotillas are deployed to meet specific strategic objectives to disrupt the enemy’s military operations or economy, or defend against such attempts by the enemy. A powerful navy can never win you the war on its own, but if deployed correctly under the right circumstances it can be the “ace in the hole” that lets you outsmart even a foe that’s superior on paper.  </p>

<p>​As with land warfare and Generals, you control your navy through your Admirals. Generals and Admirals share many similarities. Both are provided with military resources originating from buildings in the Strategic Region they call home. The amount of resources they get depend on their Rank, which you can grant via promotions to reward your favorite commanders. Their Rank also lends Political Strength / Clout to the character’s favored Interest Group. Furthermore, both Generals and Admirals get Traits that affect both themselves and those Officers and Servicemen serving underneath them.  </p>
<p>Most importantly, just like Generals are your interface to command your armies, Admirals are the interface to your navies. Admirals are given Orders, which they attempt to carry out to the best of their ability using the Flotillas they have been assigned. These Orders consist of:  </p>
<p><strong>Intercept</strong> any hostile navies around a certain Strategic Region’s friendly coastlines while keeping your fleets stationed close to shore  </p>
<p><strong>Patrol</strong> any shipping lanes between the Admiral’s home region and a remote region, intercepting any hostile navies encountered  </p>
<p><strong>Convoy Raid</strong> at a particular point at sea to damage enemy shipping lanes  </p>
<p><strong>Naval Invasion</strong> to establish a beachhead and a frontline on enemy soil, by escorting and protecting a General’s land forces in a joint operation  </p>
<p>While it has not yet made its way into the game, we also want to add a fifth Order - <strong>Blockade</strong> - to disable enemy ports and prevent hostile forces from crossing straits.  </p>

<p>​Convoy Raid and Naval Invasion are <em>aggressive</em> orders intended to hurt the enemy in different ways, while Intercept and Patrol are defensive orders that counter the other two. But to really understand how these work we have to start by talking about Shipping Lanes and the Supply Network.  </p>
<p>Shipping Lanes are facilitated by vessels called Convoys, which are an output of Port buildings. These are created automatically whenever it’s necessary to move goods and/or people overseas. The three main reasons this happens are due to naval Trade Routes between non-adjacent markets, remote States connecting to their Market through a Port, and Battalions sent to frontlines that can only be supplied by ship. When a player is about to take an action that establishes such a shipping lane they are warned of how many new Convoys would be required for this action, which is based on the size of the route or the army supplied.  </p>
<p>Shipping Lanes are always established via the shortest possible path, as defined by the number of nodes in the naval network it passes through.  </p>
<p><em>A zoomed-out view of the North Angolan shoreline above, showing the main route ships travel off the coast of southwest Africa. The yellow pin indicates this path is part of Portugal’s Supply Network.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2324%20-%20Navies%20and%20Admirals/dd24-3.jpg"><img alt="dd24-3.jpg" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2324%20-%20Navies%20and%20Admirals/dd24-3.jpg" title="dd24-3.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Emtriz Luanda WIP</font></p>
<p>​The sum total of a country’s Shipping Lanes determine the extent of its Supply Network, and the total cost in Convoys of that network compared to the Convoy output by Ports determine the overall strength of that network. That is to say, if the total Shipping Lane cost is 500 Convoys but Ports provide only 400, the Supply Network as a whole will operate at only 80% efficiency. This impacts all Shipping Lanes, causing less trade to flow between the markets than would be optimal and impacting the supply and morale of overseas troops.  </p>
<p>Admirals assigned to Convoy Raid a given sea node will surreptitiously try to sink any enemy transports that pass through. In effect this will do damage over time to the affected Shipping Lanes, causing both an overall drop in efficiency of the affected countries’ Supply Networks but also a larger, local drop in efficiency of the damaged Shipping Lanes. As a result, by parking your fleet in a highly trafficked part of the ocean you could do a lot of damage to your enemy’s trade or even directly impact the amount of military supplies they’re able to send to their frontlines.  </p>

<p>​Admirals assigned to Patrol a certain stretch of their Supply Network will eventually be able to detect and engage the raiding navy, causing a naval battle to ensue which will not only sink ships but also send the losing side back to base for repairs for some time. Admirals assigned to Intercept all nodes along a coastline are able to do the same to any raiders along the coast. Convoy Raiding right outside a major entry/exit port, such as in the English Channel, therefore has the chance to seriously disrupt a large number of shipping lanes but also put you at greater risk of detection and interception than if you’re raiding transatlantic shipping lanes on the deep seas. The composition of your navy can also greatly impact how this plays out: a fleet with an accompaniment of Submarines can deal more damage before being intercepted, while a fleet of Monitors has an easier time intercepting raiders but may be more easily sunk if faced down by a more powerful navy.  </p>
<p>Because the distance Admirals must patrol plays a difference, there is an inherent asymmetry to Convoy Raiding and Patrol orders. Since a chain is only as strong as its weakest link the damage done to a shipping lane by raiders is the same whether it stretches across 1 node or 10, whereas 10x as many Flotillas are needed to protect the longer route as effectively as the shorter.  </p>

<p>​Naval Invasion is an Order you give to provide naval support for a General’s landing on an enemy coastline. The size of the fleet determines two things: one, how great is the chance that you’ll be able to defeat an opponent’s intercepting fleet, and two, how many Battalions will you be able to successfully land. Even if the enemy has no defensive fleet at all, a naval invasion with a very small fleet might land too weak of an initial force to withstand the enemy’s counter-offense before the rest of the army can arrive. Since Naval Invasion is a one-time Order, once it has been completed it automatically turns into a Patrol Order to protect the shipping lane supplying the new Front.  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: EARLY RAFT</font></p>
<p>​Navies are made up of Flotillas, which are constructed and maintained by Naval Bases. Naturally these can only be built on coastlines, where they consume military vessels such as Man-o-Wars or Ironclads constructed in Shipyards. Like Barracks they also employ Servicemen and Officers Pop, and depending on your navy configuration may need to consume other military goods as well (such as Ammunition and Radios) in order to keep in fighting condition. Flotillas differ from Battalions in how long it takes to create and upgrade them; constructing a competitive navy is not something you can begin considering when your rival has already started saber-rattling.  </p>
<p>Another difference between Battalions and Flotillas is that your country’s navy is always considered to be in fully active service. In peacetime Generals can keep their troops on low alert, limiting their consumption and expenses. Once war breaks out, Generals can be selectively mobilized to only deploy the troops necessary. Admirals on the other hand have exorbitant needs and expenses even while at peace, so sizing and tech’ing your navy appropriately is an important consideration for imperialists on a tight budget.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, navies provide you with considerable Power Projection which confers substantial Prestige onto your country. Having a world-class navy is not strictly a requirement to be a Great Power, particularly if you’re a large self-sustaining terrestrial empire, but it definitely helps you both gain and hold onto the title.  </p>

​Before we wrap up for this week, I want to say a few words about the lack of an order to just “seek out and destroy enemy forces”. In Victoria 3, your commanders - Generals as well as Admirals - are given strategic objectives which they use their manpower and resources to carry out as best they can. If in the process they get into conflict with the enemy’s forces (as they almost certainly will at some point) a battle will ensue. The outcome of that battle determines which direction the war proceeds in. The intent of this is to remove the need to babysit your commanders.  </p>
<p>To illustrate this, assume we <em>did</em> have an order to seek and destroy. The optimal choice would then be to assign this order only to the strongest commander, fight the eventual battle, then revoke this order and give it to another commander while the first one recuperates, and so on.  </p>
<p>With an order like “advance front” instead, the General’s intention is simply to capture territory as efficiently as possible, ideally while avoiding enemy interference. If it’s impossible to avoid the enemy, the imperative is to try to be intercepted by as weak of an enemy force as possible. Meanwhile the intent behind “defend front” is the opposite: prevent enemy incursions by defending it in the places where the enemy might advance, bringing to bear as powerful a force as possible. Similarly at sea, “convoy raiding” is about maximizing shipping lane damage while avoiding detection, while “patrol” is about minimizing damage to convoys <em>by</em> seeking out and destroying those enemy ships attacking them - not to sink ships for its own sake.  </p>
<p>Depending on how the war is developing your priorities or overall strategy might certainly shift, causing you to change the orders you’ve assigned or make changes in your ranks to distribute resources differently. But our design intent is that this should only be necessary because your strategy is evolving, not to counter enemy movements or try to minmax your way to victory.  </p>
<p>This is an especially important consideration for the naval part of the warfare mechanics. Naval (and aerial) warfare in strategy games commonly face the design challenge of extreme mobility options due to the lack of obstacles to movement. Usually some form of Fog of War and interception-radius mechanics is employed to counteract turtling behavior. The AI also often has to be forced to make mistakes to not become <em>too good</em> at dodging or intercepting the player in this environment. Even with Victoria 3’s more strategic-level decision making, the freedom of “movement” the sea provides would make a system where being in/avoiding being in the same location as the enemy so as to start/not start a battle extremely micro-heavy, annoying, and highly unfair to either human or AI players depending on implementation.  </p>
<p>So instead, in Victoria 3, you tell your Admirals what their overall priorities should be for the war and then they try to do that, using the resources they’ve been allocated, only coming into conflict when they become aware of an enemy Admiral with an order that clashes with their own.  </p>
<p>I hope that gives you a good idea of what to expect from the naval mechanics in Victoria 3. Next week we will wrap up this first batch of diaries on the military system by going through the many economic impacts of warfare in Victoria 3. Until then!</p>

<p>Their Orders do not conflict, so no battle will transpire. Similarly, if all Generals on a Front are set to Defend that Front, no battles will break out. This is totally legit, since either side might be choosing these Orders because they know they have the inferior force and just want to ensure they do as much damage as possible without risking their men in an attack.</p>

<p>It's not an instant or painless process: you'll need to secure new input goods, switch to the new ship type, and then suffer major disruption for some time to the naval bases/warships that are being upgraded. Replacing wooden warships with ironclads isn't done overnight.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you cut off Russian sugar imports and they're heavily dependent on those imports, you'll trigger crippling sugar shortages in the Russian Market, which could for instance completely tank their Food Industries' output.</p>

Could I for example have three naval invasions going or even multiple naval invasions against the Islands of Japan to take it over as quickly as possible and hit them in multiple spots at once?

<p>There is no hard cap, if you can spare the resources required, go ahead!</p>

<p>It's focused around a capital ship with escorts and support vessels, yes. With respect to smaller vessels like monitors which would have multiples to a group, the Flotilla is considered to be named after one of them. Like Battalions, Flotillas are scaled to represent the combined force of 1000 Servicemen and Officers.</p>

<p>In the current build of the game it is only the number of nodes, thus the suspiciously round number in the tooltip there. We are going to change this soon so it scales with the amount of goods that shipping lane moves * how long it is in nodes.</p>

<p>Everything produced and consumed in Victoria 3's economic model is essentially a "capacity" in the sense you mean here, including Convoys. But we've made it so it still takes time for damaged shipping lanes to recover once raiding stops.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 25 THE COST OF WAR</font></p>
<p>​Today marks the final entry in our 4-part overview of the warfare mechanics of Victoria 3. If you’re just tuning in now, we have previously covered <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-22-the-concept-of-war.1496459/">The Concept of War</a>, <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-23-fronts-and-generals.1497106/">Fronts and Generals</a>, and <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-24-navies-and-admirals.1498202/">Navies and Admirals</a> which introduces many of the core concepts fleshed out in this diary.  </p>
<p>That war costs substantial money and resources is hardly a novel concept. Most strategy games impose a cost for creating military units, some have upkeep costs, and even in Pop-less Paradox GSGs a metric such as a Manpower pool often has to be regenerated in order to replenish damaged units. A few games even encourage you to peace-out of wars that are so costly your treasury can’t bear the expense for as long as it takes to win, even if you still have armies left standing.  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3 we aim to take this to the next level by modelling the truly astronomical, often lasting expenses of war in the economic system. This includes letting players and Pops profit off of wars; employ economic tools such as trade disruptions to gain military leverage; encourage upgrading not only your military but also industrial output to match; reform your Laws to fit your military to your economy; ensure your Infrastructure is sufficient to maintain your country while at war; and invest in medical corps and medicine to treat your population traumatized by the frontlines.  </p>
<p>The intention here is not only to give the player a lot of economic levers to pull to prepare their country for war, although that is certainly part of it. A big reason for making wars approach the real-life cost is to encourage the player to think hard about the <em>opportunity cost</em> of war - that is, what you’re missing out on by spending your resources on war instead of something else - and incentivize solving your diplomatic conflicts before war breaks out. If war was a cost-effective way both of increasing your power <em>and</em> decreasing your enemy’s power, diplomacy would be relegated to nothing but faux formalities before fighting begins. But if neither party truly <em>desires</em> a war, no matter the power discrepancy between them, that’s when the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-21-diplomatic-plays.1495892/">Diplomatic Play</a> intimidation game to see who blinks first can become real and tense.  </p>
<p>It also means that it’s a skill to <em>know when to stop</em>. If war was an all-or-nothing affair this would not be an issue, but in Victoria 3 wars rarely result in one side getting everything they asked for (as we will learn more about next week, when we cover the Peace Deals system). Once you have hurt your enemy enough you might accept a consolation prize and sign a truce, knowing you will recover better over the next five years than they will.  </p>
<p>With that said, let’s dig into the details.  </p>
<p><em>Your ability to sustain your war machine is of crucial importance in peace as well as war. At the start of the game many countries can get away with maintaining an army of self-supporting Irregular Infantry to keep the costs of arms down, but this won’t be possible for long. And while wages might be affordable when your country is underdeveloped, increased productivity and labor competition will eventually raise expectations.</em>  </p>

<p>​Your country’s <em>Army Model</em> is a type of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-7-laws.1483581/">Law</a> that governs who makes up your military and how they are organized. We currently have four Army Models planned:  </p>
<p>Under a <strong>Peasant Levy</strong> model, a permanent military force supported by Barracks is non-existent or minimal in size. Instead the country may raise large numbers of conscripted levies of irregulars during wartime, led by Officers originating from the aristocracy. This model is cheap to maintain during peacetime but can get very expensive (particularly in lives) during war. Conscripted Battalions can also take a long time to organize, and provide no Power Projection that affects the country’s Prestige.  </p>
<p>The <strong>National Militia</strong> model limits your standing army and Power Projection in much the same way as Peasant Levies, but permits you to conscript a large part of your population into a well-rounded national defense force if needed. These conscripted troops cannot be mobilized and are therefore automatically assigned to their local garrisons, unavailable to Generals to use to advance Fronts. It’s the model of choice for countries who want to focus on homeland defense, or countries desiring to democratize the military and limit the power of the Armed Forces.  </p>
<p><strong>Mass Conscription</strong> becomes available once you have unlocked the Society “tech” <em>Nationalism</em>. It lets you enlist the same large number of conscripts as National Militia but does not limit the size of your standing army, and all these conscripts are assigned under Generals as needed. In addition, conscripts are trained faster but are limited to infantry troops only. This is the correct choice for countries fighting no-holds-barred existential conflicts where sending regular waves of fresh meat to the frontlines is imperative.  </p>
<p>A <strong>Regular Army</strong> model lets a country maintain an army of any size even in peacetime. While it also permits for conscription of a smaller number of civilians as needed, its standing army is the pride of the nation and confers considerable Prestige onto it. This model has the greatest flexibility in terms of military Production Methods, letting countries configure their armies without restrictions. Technologically advanced countries relying on more expensive crack troops rather than sheer numbers favor this Law.  </p>
<p><em>Like all Laws, changing your Army Model will be popular with some Interest Groups and not with others, and in most cases you need to have at least a semi-legitimate government that favors the Law in order to have a chance to pass it without major complications. The icons you see for these Laws are not yet finalized.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2325%20-%20The%20Cost%20of%20War/dd25-2.PNG"><img alt="dd25-2.PNG" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2325%20-%20The%20Cost%20of%20War/dd25-2.PNG" title="dd25-2.PNG" /></a></p>

Army every Army being</font></p>
<p>​<strong>Conscripting</strong> the civilian population into military service is an option available to all countries, but only during wartime or when the country is at threat of war (i.e. when it is actively participating in a Diplomatic Play). Conscripted Battalions do not Project Power and therefore do not impart Prestige, and under some Army Models they do not have access to certain advanced Production Methods that require specialized training.  </p>
<p>Conscripts can be activated state by state or all across your country at once. Activating conscripts creates a <em>Conscription Center</em> in the state where civilians are recruited into temporary military service, and the cost of these conscripts are only incurred as they become active. This means relying on conscripting civilians as needed can be a compelling strategy to keep the military budget down, but it does not come without its own costs.  </p>
<p>First and foremost, when the Conscription Center appears, recruited Pops will leave their regular places of work en masse which could cause major temporary disruptions to your nation’s economy. If the conscripts in a certain state happen to primarily originate from the lower strata of its underpaying Lead Mines, this will reduce output and thereby affect the Glasswork and Munitions Plants that consume the lead produced in your market, which in turn will impact all its Urban Centers as well as your very military machinery. If you have enough Pops in search of labor this situation will correct itself over time as the Lead Mines rehire their lost workers, but in the long run this simple action of initiating conscription in a single state will still mean a shift in Wealth distribution, political allegiances, population distribution, industrial profitability, and so on. Even after a successfully prosecuted war those men returning home alive may need to look for new opportunities to regain their old Standard of Living. Everything has consequences.  </p>
<p>Second, conscripted Battalions are always created from scratch which can take a lot of time. This means they lose any experience gained in the last armed conflict as they stand down, while your standing army units will get more and more impressive over time. Soldier for soldier, conscripts give you less bang for your buck.  </p>
<p>Third, conscripted Battalions are distributed among your Generals by their normal Rank-based proportions and aren’t automatically mobilized as soon as they emerge. So first the conscript Battalions need to be recruited and created from scratch, and then any conscript Battalions assigned to mobilized Generals must also mobilize in order to be able to leave for the front. As we explored in the Front and Generals diary, when such a large number of Battalions are raised all at once it is Infrastructure that governs how quickly they will be able to get ready, so this needs to be taken into account when choosing where to recruit your conscripts.  </p>
<p>While all of the above happens automatically with the press of a button, the impact can be complex and will be experienced over time. Choosing to activate conscripts in the populous but rural vineyard valleys of Rhone will have a very different effect on France than activating conscripts in industrialized, well-connected Paris.  </p>
<p><em>Mass Mobilization may provide access to vast numbers of fighting men, but redirecting up to 25 percent of your capable workforce to the war effort (in this case 60 Battalions, or the equivalent workforce required to staff about 12 levels of farms, mines, or manufacturing industries) could play a real number on your economy. These visuals are a work in progress, but demonstrates how the player functionally interacts with the map through the “lens” system either through clicking directly on regions of the map or by selecting options from a list.</em>  </p>

<p>​A very tangible cost is of course the actual money you are spending on military goods for mobilized troops in the field. While Barracks consume military goods at all times in proportion to the number of Battalions it supports, units that are mobilized consume twice the normal maintenance level of goods. Not only does this double the quantity you need to buy, it also puts a lot of additional demand on the goods, raising the price-per-unit as well. As long as they can keep their production levels steady, your domestic Arms Industries, Munition Plants, and War Machine Industries will see profits skyrocket off of this increased consumption of your mobilized troops.  </p>
<p>This also means other nations - allies or neutral parties - will see the sudden benefit of exporting arms to you. If you normally export military goods to others you may wish to cancel these routes to keep prices down, while if neutral parties import arms from you this may be a good time to Embargo (or at least Tariff) these goods. Every little bit helps your treasury and ultimately your frontline troops.  </p>
<p>Trade routes criss-crossing the ocean are susceptible to your enemy’s Convoy Raiding fleets. Until a patrol discovers them and sends them to home base for repairs, such a fleet can do considerable damage both to your supply network as a whole (affecting all Trade Routes as well as the supply of overseas Generals) and to some shipping lanes in particular, possibly crippling your country’s access to strategic goods like Small Arms or hard-to-find imports such as Radios. Compromising a country’s access to industrial, luxury, or even staple goods can also be devastating to their ability to stay in the war, as we will learn more about next week!  </p>
<p>Convoy Raiding fleets can also damage connections to overseas markets, for example by compromising the East India Company’s connection to London. This could potentially devastate the economies of clusters of dozens of states who may have come to rely on such a connection to survive, particularly if their economies aren’t locally well-balanced but relying on cash crops or specialized manufacturing.  </p>
<p>*Many countries rely on foreign trade to supply them not only with the additional arms they require during wartime, but also the consumer goods required to keep morale up on the home front in this difficult time. Ending up on the opposite side of your trading partners during Diplomatic Plays could be catastrophic for the war effort. On this screenshot we can see the British used to supply the Ottomans with 100 units of Artillery each week, but with Great Britain now siding with Russia they will have to try to find a new trading partner as soon as possible - or try to hold the Russians off despite an Artillery shortage. Another potential crisis the Ottomans have to deal with is the imminent stoppage of a smaller amount of Liquor and enormous quantities of Luxury Clothes, at least the latter of which is prone to make many wealthy Pops feel this war might carry too high a price.  </p>
<p>(on this screenshot we can also see some suspiciously round numbers of Available vs Required Convoys - these are currently placeholder values, which will be replaced with values properly scaled to the number of units traded across the number of nodes)*  </p>

<p>​The goods, technologies, and in some cases Laws you have access to practically limit which military Production Methods you have available to you. These determine the composition of your army and navy and include both “upgrades” and “options”. As always, this list is not finalized but represents what is in the current build of the game only.  </p>
<p>Your <strong>Infantry Organization</strong> Production Methods govern the organization and doctrines of your army’s core fighting force. They consume mostly Small Arms and Ammunition and include Irregular, Line, Skirmish, Trench, and Squad Infantry. Offense, Defense, and Training Rate are the most commonly affected attributes.  </p>
<p><strong>Artillery Support</strong> Production Methods consume expensive Artillery and Ammunition to boost the Offense, Morale Damage, Kill Rate, and Devastation attributes of the Battalions. Cannons, Mobile, Shrapnel, and Siege Artillery are represented.  </p>
<p>Your Battalions’ <strong>Mobility</strong> options affect their ability to get around and scout the terrain, impacting their ability to do damage during an Offense and capture larger amounts of territory at the conclusion of a won battle. Cavalry forces are the default, which can eventually be supplemented with Bicycle Messengers, and after the turn of the century Aerial Reconnaissance or even an Armored Division supplied by late-game War Machines Industries producing <em>Aeroplanes</em> and <em>Tanks</em>.  </p>
<p>Your standing army can unlock various <strong>Specialist Companies</strong> for Barracks to focus on. These include Machine Gunners, Infiltrators, Flamethrower Companies, and Chemical Weapon Specialists. These specialists consume various goods to inflict quite specific effects.  </p>
<p><strong>Medical Aid</strong> determines what sort of battlefield medicine your troops have access to, from the default of Wound Dressing, through First Aid, to fully fledged Field Hospitals. These consume Fabric and Opium to treat the sick and wounded to minimize the casualties inflicted by attrition and combat alike.  </p>
<p><em>Access to Opium permits you to care for your injured population during wartime, but while the country is at peace the excess Opium floating around your market may result in Pops developing an unhealthy Obsession with the drug. This is less of a problem if you are the producer than if you’re relying on imports for your supply, of course.</em>  </p>

<p>​Similarly, Naval Bases also consume goods to produce Flotillas with different attributes. These are due for a design pass so I won’t go into details which are prone to change anyway. But in broad strokes, the fundamental Production Method determines the class of the central vessel that defines each Flotilla: is this a Man-o-War, Ironclad, Monitor, Dreadnought, or Battleship? In addition to the class of your central vessel, do you have Submarines or even Aeroplane Carriers accompanying your fleet? All these have pros and cons for different types of missions, letting you specialize your fleet for protecting or attacking trade routes, performing naval invasions, or blockading ports.  </p>
<p>If you’ve paid especially close attention you might now ask: we know you must mobilize your army and Generals to see effective use of them in wartime, but what about mobilizing your navy and Admirals? In fact, navies are considered to always be ready and in active service and do not need mobilization. You also cannot recruit conscripts to start manning your warships just as a war breaks out, for obvious reasons. This means expanding and upgrading your navy is both a long-term process and a long-term investment. Navies are excellent at Projecting Power however, so while an impressive navy might not be particularly useful outside of armed conflict it will at least grant you considerable Prestige even as it burns its way through your treasury.  </p>
<p>Since navies do not cost any more during war than in peace you may as well use them! You can set up most Orders for your Admirals any time, even while at peace. Once they spot ships flying hostile flags they will take action automatically.  </p>
<p>A less direct cost of war which nonetheless can have severe consequences is <strong>Devastation</strong>. This reflects direct damage to an entire state and its infrastructure caused by battles transpiring in that state. Particularly large degrees of Devastation is inflicted by battles involving heavy and sustained artillery barrages. Devastation directly impacts Infrastructure and thereby Market Access, making the state economically unsustainable. It also tends to cause migration away from the state, an increase in Pop mortality, and other very detrimental effects. After the war this damage will be gradually reversed, but this rebuilding effort can take a long time and cause a lot of economic upheaval in the process.  </p>

<p>Finally, of course, there is the human cost of war. Some wars end with only a few hundred casualties on both sides; some wars claim millions of lives with no peace deal in sight. In Victoria 3 it is your actual population who fight and die for your causes - the same population that harvest your fields and work at your assembly lines, who vote for their preferred party or rebel against your enlightened rule, who learn to read and write or pack up and move in search of greener pastures.  </p>
<p>Many men fall in battle of course, but more commonly they perish on the way to the battle, or after the battle, whether from disease, starvation, infections, or exposure. Simply mobilizing your forces to the front will increase their risk of dying or suffering lifelong disability. To counteract this you can research and invest in good frontline medical care, or favor Generals with proven ability to reduce such needless casualties.  </p>
<p>Those casualties who do not recover from their injuries and return to the frontline will either return home as Dependents or die outright. As a result of both of these effects, after a major war your Pops are likely to consist of an outsized proportion of Dependents to Workforce. While this will self-adjust over time (especially if birth rate is high) there may well be a post-war period where you’re forced to deal with a large portion of your population not being economically productive. It’s in cases like these you’ll be glad you’ve enacted a good Pension System to ease this impact during the recovery period.  </p>
<p>In closing and to reiterate, Victoria 3 emphasizes the cost of war for several reasons, including:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It raises the stakes and thus increases the payoff for solving conflicts diplomatically</li>
<li>It creates meaningful economic interplays between the economy and military, increasing the need to prepare and build a reliable “engine”</li>
<li>It enables cost/benefit analysis as a strategic tool, making the best strategist not necessarily the one that uses overwhelming force but the one that uses just enough force to get what they want</li>
</ul>
<p>Next week we will learn more about how you can leverage the effects of these exorbitant costs by making Peace Deals favoring you look relatively attractive to your opponent. Until then!</p>

<p>One more question - will conscripted battalions have conscripted officers as well? If yes, which pops will they be drafted from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Officers come from whoever has Qualifications to become one, which are often Servicemen (so you might see Servicemen from Barracks get recruited as Officers in Conscription Centers, meaning having a standing army makes it easier to raise lots of conscripts in a pinch) but can also come from other Professions, especially Aristocrats. Under a Peasant Levy model, it's almost <em>always</em> Aristocrats that have the qualifications to become Officers.</p>

<p>I posted this on reddit with some positive responses so I'll repost here: This war system could be great to give players a very interesting political tool. With a large enough war and the correct government form, you could take emergency measures to temporarily enact laws that you couldn't otherwise (getting a relations hit with the opposition of course), maybe give a tool to make temporary laws permanent later on.  </p>
<p>This would be amazing both as a role play, historical and pure gameplay tool! Smile    :)  </p>
<p>Historically, many wars were used to also squash political/democratic opposition, or advance social reforms (women in the workforce for instance). You could simulate power grabs by the monarchy or military juntas, using wars as a pretext to squash nascent democracies. This would give us so many options!  </p>
<p>Is a similar system on the table?  </p>

<p>Also, a pure question: Does the devastation modifier mean the population is lost over time wile the modifier lasts? Does this effect persist in devastated territories after the war?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pops always die off at a certain pace, depending on their Standard of Living. This is usually compensated for (and then some) due to Pops giving birth. Devastation causes the natural mortality to magnify significantly, meaning that at high levels of devastation Pop growth will be negative, and quite severely so.  </p>
<p>The effect remains for as long as the territory is occupied. As it's reconquered or liberated after the war, Devastation starts to slowly dissipate. Of course, reconquering it also requires battles, which increases Devastation...</p>

<p>Hey! There is one thing I wanted to ask you guys about this.  </p>
<p>I have noticed, in part, that a lot of the systems of Victoria 3 seemed designed around making playing as something like the British Empire a engaging, interesting and approachable experience. I have to ask if, because of that, <strong>wouldn't most countries be pushed towards sort of 'acting like the United Kingdom' if they want to be successful in the system?</strong>  </p>
<p>Things like the importance of global trade, navies being generally less costly to upkeep then land armies, and the strength that a nation with wide borders has to pick and choose wars against weaker isolated nations all generally seemed aimed at making colonization fun.  </p>
<p>I am just wondering how this system will work for nations that aren't in a position like the UK, nations like the United States, China and Prussia - typically nations with a concentrated power base that don't really have the same freedom to pick and choose the conflicts they want to engage in as easily as someone with wide borders can. While in this era you did see these land-based nations partake in colonialism IRL - German Qingdao and American Liberia are good examples - that really wasn't those nations strengths.  </p>
<p>Either way love what I am seeing! Going to uni for game design in January and its wonderful seeing things like this written up, which I imagine aren't too different at all from the base design documents you use internally. Its a great insight into the design of the game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have to say I never really thought about this before, but while it's true that the UK is obviously an inspiration for a lot of the mechanics in the game, one of the things I personally like the most about the game is how differently it plays as countries in different geographical conditions. Access to resources, vicinity to neighbors, access to shoreline, state traits, etc have a large impact on the games I play, and I often don't feel like I have to engage in all the features as all countries (such as colonization). It's something to watch out for though, it's definitely not our intent that all countries should play as if they were a proto-UK!</p>

<p>We tried this first, but the often drastic increases in Pop standard of living that came with it didn't feel realistic. Like, there are a bunch of clerks and shopkeepers here who'd love a 10% pay raise, but instead my recruiters go out and uplift the entire countryside's destitute Peasant population first, making them insanely loyal to the state in the process? It's cool, but didn't seem very realistic and had me scratching my head for a while wondering what was going on.</p>

<p>But I wonder if I have missunderstood how garisons work. Under national militia, if your border regions are sparsely populated, would they only be defended by the conscripts in those states? Can't move garrisons from your more populated areas to the front?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is correct, under a National Militia model the conscripted population "defend their homes" and do not engage in cross-continental marches. It's <em>Strategic Region</em> level though, which is a lot larger than states. So what you'd probably want to do in a huge country like the US or Russia would be to activate conscripts along the border regions first and delay activating the ones further from the border until it becomes clear you need to. You can also maintain a small standing army whose Generals you can order to any Front you like.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Military buildings whose state is fully occupied by the enemy lose their ability to supply their Battalions (or Flotillas), which means that General/Admiral loses that amount of Supply and have to redistribute between their available troops. This basically means max Morale will drop for the detachments those Battalions are part of.  </p>
<p>We don't have any systems for sending advisors or volunteers, and you can only send a General as an expeditionary forces if you sided with the country in the Diplomatic Play that started the war.</p>

<p>You never tariff your <em>own</em> trade. Foreign trade, whether imports <em>from</em> your market or exports <em>to</em> your market, are subject to tariffs. In the context of the phrasing in the dev diary, if you have trading partners who get their military supplies from you, you might want to embargo or apply tariffs to such trade during the war to keep national supply high and price low.</p>

<p>Your mobilized Generals can still advance a Front under this model. If you opt not to have a standing army of any size at all, then yes you'll be stuck with people focusing only on standing their ground and defending their homes instead of planning elaborate counter-offenses to win military victories, but that's your choice.</p>

<p>There's no "Interest Group" for war veterans, but of course the Armed Forces Interest Group include Servicemen and Officers, and even Pops who used to be conscripted soldiers for a long time a while back who haven't "realigned" yet.

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 26 PEACE DEALS</font></p>
<p>​  </p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to another Victoria 3 development diary! Last week we wrapped up our dev diaries on War, and now we’ll be bringing both Diplomacy and War to a close (for the being, that is) by talking about (appropriately enough) how to negotiate an end to one of your wars. We’re of course not done talking about warfare and will return to the topic at a later point, but for now, let’s talk peace.  </p>
<p>So, let’s say you launched that diplomatic play to get the Dutch colony you’ve been eyeing for years thinking that you’d have it in the bag, all the way up until the French decided to back them up and you found yourself dragged into a bloody and costly conflict that you now want nothing more than to get out of. What do you do?  </p>
<p>There’s actually two different ways of making peace in Victoria 3: <strong>Capitulating</strong> and <strong>Negotiating Peace</strong>. However, before we explain how these work, we first need to explain a crucial mechanic to all forms of peace-making: <strong>War Support</strong>.  </p>
<p>War Support is a measure of the political will in your country to continue fighting in a particular war, and goes from -100 to +100. Each country will start a war with a high degree of War Support (currently always 100, though we’re considering having it start on different levels based on how politically unified your country is), which declines over time. The factors that govern how quickly War Support drops include:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Having your territory occupied by the enemy</li>
<li>Pops dying and being wounded in battle and from attrition</li>
<li>Internal turmoil in your country, for example because your economy is worsening due to the war</li>
<li>Whether the enemy controls their War Goals</li>
</ul>
<p>*Siam is in a bad way in this war, losing more than 11 War Support every single week. Unless they can turn things around quickly, capitulation isn’t far away. As with the previous war dev diaries, please note that any numbers/interfaces/tooltips shown are very much not final!  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2326%20-%20Peace%20Deals/DD26_1.png"><img alt="DD26_1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2326%20-%20Peace%20Deals/DD26_1.png" title="DD26_1.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: War Support Siam) Current Value: -33.2 WIP Initial War Support: 0.0 From Exhaustion: -133.2 In 6 days will get -11.11 due to Exhaustion -0.50 from Base Decay -7.54 because they are 75.4% Occupied ~2.00 because their enemy controls 100.0% oftheir Wargoals 0.00 because they have taken 0K casualities -1.07 because 21.5% of their population are Radical 0.00 because of situations they</font>*​  </p>
<p>When their War Support hits -100, a country is forced to Capitulate. A country that Capitulates cedes all War Goals that are targeting them and gives up on all unpressed War Goals they were still holding. It’s also possible for most countries part of a war to choose to Capitulate at any time, even right after the war has broken out. This will immediately let them exit the war at the same cost outlined above, but may also incur a diplomatic penalty if the country capitulates early, especially if they had nothing to lose by doing so (as it would be seen as a cowardly betrayal of your allies). War Leaders are also able to Capitulate, and this doesn’t usually end the war, as they are only conceding War Goals targeting themselves and their subjects, and a new War Leader will be chosen to continue the fight on their side of the struggle. The only circumstance under which a Capitulation will end a War is if there are no War Goals left to fight over, which always results in an immediate end to hostilities.  </p>
<p>However, it isn’t possible to simply attack a far-away country and force them to cede you distant lands simply by waiting for their War Support to tick down by itself. This is because any country that has a war goal targeting it which isn’t considered to be controlled by the enemy <strong>and</strong> still retains control of its own capital cannot have its War Support drop below 0. For example, let’s say that while playing as Brazil, you attack the Netherlands and demand they cede both Curacao and Guyana. You easily occupy Guyana but find that your navy is outmatched and you can’t land armies to take either Curacao or Amsterdam. As a result, you will be unable to force the Netherlands to Capitulate unless you actively choose to drop your War Goal on Curacao.  </p>
<p><em>It’s possible to capitulate at any time during a war, even when it’s just started and War Support is at maximum - that it’s possible definitely doesn’t mean it’s a good idea, though!</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2326%20-%20Peace%20Deals/DD26_2.png"><img alt="DD26_2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2326%20-%20Peace%20Deals/DD26_2.png" title="DD26_2.png" /></a></p>

<p>So what then, of negotiated peace? This is quite a bit more complex than Capitulation, and can involve a whole host of countries that are part of the war. When making peace, countries involved in a war are split into three different categories:  </p>
<p><strong>War Leaders</strong>: This is the main participant on each side. War Leaders can propose peace deals and must ratify any proposed peace from the other War Leader in order for it to take effect.  </p>
<p><strong>Negotiators</strong>: This is any country that either holds a War Goal or has a War Goal targeting them and who are not one of the War Leaders. Negotiators must ratify any proposed peace deal from <strong>both the enemy and their own side</strong> in order for it to take effect.  </p>
<p><strong>Non-Negotiators</strong>: This is any country that doesn’t fall into the above two categories. They don’t play any active role in peace negotiations. Subjects whose Overlord is part of the war are also considered Non-Negotiators, as their Overlord negotiates on their behalf.  </p>
<p>For a negotiated peace to happen, the War Leader on either side must first construct and propose a peace deal out of pressed War Goals. Unlike in many of our other Grand Strategy Games, peace deals in Victoria 3 isn’t necessarily just one side making demands - the War Leader can propose a mixed peace deal, in which War Goals are ceded from both sides. Once the War Leader is satisfied with the deal they’re proposing, they then send it out to <strong>both sides of the war</strong> for ratification.  </p>
<p><em>This rebellion against Britain has turned into something of a brush war between the European Great Powers, with limited fighting in the colonies between Britain and its enemy France. War Support remains high, but if things take a bloodier turn both sides may find their populations quickly growing weary of the fighting.</em>  </p>

<p>​That’s right - in order to have your proposed peace deal take effect, you need not just the enemy War Leader or even the enemy War Leader and Negotiators agree to it - all Negotiators on your own side must agree as well. This means that while you can try to cut a deal with your Dutch enemy to give you everything you want from them in exchange for selling out your ally Prussia, the likely answer to that from Prussia is going to be a firm and resounding ‘No’, at least so long as they aren’t truly desperate for a peace. However, if you’re willing to be fair about the whole thing and give up something of your own as well, they’re going to be more receptive to your proposals.  </p>
<p>War Support plays a key role in determining what kind of peace deals the AI will agree to, with both their own and the enemy’s War Support factoring in: Even if their war support has dropped into the negative, the AI isn’t going to agree to a long list of demands from a country that is themselves a few weeks away from capitulating.  </p>
<p>That’s all for today! Now that we’ve talked about Economy, Politics, Diplomacy and War, join us again next week as we cover a topic that touches on all of them - Technology!</p>

<p>To answer several questions on the topic, there are currently no plans to allow for the adding of War Goals after the war starts, as doing so opens up for a lot of ways to circumvent the Diplomatic Play phase (go in with light demands to get support in the Play and then start demanding outrageous things once the war starts, for example). If we do add such a mechanic, it would have to allow the various actors in the war to reconsider their stance, open up for intervention and so on which are all neat ideas but a complex addition that would need a substantial design and iteration pass.</p>

<p>So am I right in assuming this means there is no longer such a thing as a separate peace? What is to now prevent a small country from basically tacking itself onto a squabble with between large countries, and then having outrageous demands that they won't let go of until the larger country does all the fighting for them? Is the larger country's only recourse to basically give in to their enemy's demands, even if they are winning? Shouldn't they be able to basically say, "no, Krakow does not get to annex Germany, and I am going to take this smaller state and leave the war."?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smaller country can't simply add demands that the War Leader didn't agree to, and if they are the War Leader then their allies will need to have backed up their claims during the Diplomatic Play. Things like this is the reason that we're currently not allowing the addition of War Goals after the Play is over.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 27 TECHNOLOGY</font></p>
<p>​Welcome back to another Victoria 3 development diary! Today we will talk about something we’ve already had to touch on in numerous previous dev diaries, as it is a topic crucial to every part of the game: Technology.  </p>
<p>The Victorian era saw revolutionary progress in three major areas: industry, military, and politics. The rise of automation and free enterprise brought about the promise of immense material wealth for anyone willing and able to put in the work. Military technology - on land, at sea, and eventually even in the air - progressed so rapidly it could render a nation’s centuries-old doctrines obsolete overnight. And along with these material changes came a fundamental reorganisation of the societies themselves - sometimes by redistributing power from the ancient noble regimes to benefit the common people, and at other times by reigning such democracies in through entirely novel power structures made up of bureaucrats, business magnates, or populist autocratic strongmen.  </p>
<p>These three revolutions are represented in Victoria 3 through three distinct tech trees: Production, Military, and Society. Within each tree, the many technologies your country will discover through each game are organised such that each tech both requires one or several others and leads to one or several others. Modders might be interested to know that each tree automatically rebuilds and reorganises itself whenever changes are made, to make it pain-free to add, remove, or change the tech trees without having to tinker with tree layout or static image files.  </p>
<p><em>To research Shaft Mining, which permits the construction of mining industries, you need both Enclosure (which permits private ownership of land) and Manufactories (which lets you establish basic industries that make finished products). Shaft Mining itself leads to Prospecting (which increases your chance of discovering new resources), Steelworking (which lets you build Steel Mills), and the Atmospheric Engine, a building-sized early steam engine employed to pump water out of mine shafts. Industrialised countries start the game with most or all of these technologies.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2327%20-%20Technology/DD27%2001.png"><img alt="DD27 01.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2327%20-%20Technology/DD27%2001.png" title="DD27 01.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Enclosure Manufacturies Shaft Distillation Prospecting Atmospheric Engine Steelworking Mining</font></p>
<p>​<strong>Production</strong> technologies are all about increasing your economic capacity in various ways. These tend to be very concrete inventions, such as <em>Cotton Gin</em> which increases the output of Cotton Plantations and <em>Dynamite</em> which can be employed for increased yields in all kinds of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-3-buildings.1478868/">Mines</a>. On some occasions they are more abstract, such as <em>Enclosure</em> which is a prerequisite for construction of modern, privately owned farms and ranches or <em>Shift Work</em> which more effectively utilises labor in your manufacturing industries. Production technologies also include advances to Railways, and some even unlock <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-4-goods.1479730/">Goods</a> unknown at the start of the game such as Rubber, Electricity, and Automobiles.  </p>
<p><strong>Military</strong> technologies improve your army and navy. These consist of a mix of new weapon technologies, doctrines, and ways of organising your Servicemen and Officers. <em>Rifling</em> lets you switch <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-5-production-methods.1480760/">Production Methods</a> from Muskets to Rifles in your Arms Industries, increasing their Small Arms production. <em>Trench Infantry</em>, once employed in your Barracks, organises your Battalions for trench warfare, which requires greater access to Small Arms but establishes a more reliable supply of manpower and causes fewer provinces to be lost when territory must be yielded to the enemy. The naval part of the tree is mostly dedicated to the invention of new ship types, but also includes a few new naval strategies that unlock or improve the effectiveness of certain <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-24-navies-and-admirals.1498202/">naval Orders</a> as well as upgrades to civilian Ports to improve your Supply Network and trade capacity.  </p>
<p><strong>Society</strong> technologies are all about new ideas for organising society. These include ideas pertaining to politics, finance, and diplomacy to name a few. <em>Democracy</em> permits the enactment of various voting franchise <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-7-laws.1483581/">Laws</a> as well as Republican principles of governing. <em>Pan-Nationalism</em> is a requirement for forming certain larger countries, and leads to <em>Political Agitation</em> which both makes your population more politically active and also gives you more <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-2-capacities.1477662/">Authority</a> to deal with them. Several political ideas in this tree also unlocks specific Ideologies which may appear from that point on alongside new <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Interest Group</a> Leaders and shake up the political landscape you had so carefully tuned, such as <em>Feminism</em> and <em>Anarchism</em>. Just as techs in the Production tree often unlock Production Methods, Society techs often unlock Laws - or Ideologies that can lend support for Laws previously thought utterly absurd by the political establishment.  </p>
<p>In addition, Society technologies include improvements to your country’s financial system, such as <em>Central Banking</em> which increases your capacity for <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-12-treasury.1488588/">minting new currency</a> and unlocks the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-20-diplomatic-actions.1495234/">Diplomatic Actions</a> to <em>Bankroll</em> a country or <em>Take on</em> their <em>Debt</em>, as well as new forms of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-8-institutions.1484231/">Institutions</a> like <em>Central Archives</em> that unlock the Secret Police Law / Institution and leads to <em>Identification Documents</em>.  </p>
<p>We are aiming for roundabout 175 of these technologies in the game on release, split up across the three trees. Many countries will start with 20-30 of these technologies already researched, as their starting economies, legal systems, militaries, and diplomatic relations rely on them. On average, leading edge countries will discover perhaps one new technology per year, though this pace can vary greatly from country to country.  </p>
<p><em>An early part of the Society tech tree that deals mostly with finance and diplomacy. While a pre-industrial country might want to prioritise crucial Production technologies, missing out on elementary Society ideas that let you adjust Relations or perform effective International Trade is inadvisable. A rapidly developing country without allies could easily fall under the influence of an ambitious Great Power.</em>  </p>

<p>Embarking on the research of a new technology is a simple matter of clicking on the tech in the tree you’d like to focus on, and time will take care of the rest. But time is perhaps your <em>most</em> precious resource in Victoria 3, since falling behind your neighbours could be a death sentence - or at least might force you to cede your right to self-determination. The pace at which your research progresses is therefore of the utmost importance.  </p>
<p>The rate by which countries develop new technologies is measured by <em>Innovation</em>. All countries start with a small amount of Innovation capacity. Those countries who can afford to do so can construct and fund University buildings, which employ Academics and Clerks to boost Innovation and thereby speed up the pace at which a country discovers new things.  </p>
<p>Another way to improve research speed is to ensure the Industrialists, Armed Forces, or Intelligentsia are satisfied with the state of the country, as this will cause the effective cost of Production, Military, and Society techs respectively to drop. If only one of these groups are pleased with the society you’ve built, this will incentivize focusing your research on that tree since it’s relatively advantageous. As a result, a country with a large army and Laws favouring Patriotic, Loyalist, and Jingoist Ideologies would also progress faster in their Military technologies, though they may fall behind on Production and Society.  </p>
<p>The amount of Innovation you can use to actively research your chosen technology is capped by your country’s <em>Literacy</em>. Even if your Universities are top-notch, your country’s ability to effectively incorporate new learnings will be hampered by a poorly educated population. Those countries who aim to be the guiding light of global progress must maintain a solid primary school system in addition to Universities that carry out their research.  </p>
<p><em>Mexico is evidently on the fast-track of becoming the innovative powerhouse in the Americas, but its current Literacy rate doesn’t quite support making full directed use of the Universities they’ve built - for now.</em>  </p>

<p>​Literacy is a product of a Pop’s <em>Education</em> Access. If a given Pop has 30% Education Access, over time 30% of individuals in that Pop will become Literate. The pace by which this value changes is dependent on the birth- and death rate of the Pop, since this sort of learning happens mostly in the early years.   </p>
<p>A Pop’s Wealth provides it with a base level of Education Access, and Wealth often varies substantially depending on Profession, making higher-paid Professions have greater Education Access. However, Literacy is often a limiting factor to a Pop’s ability to <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-11-employment-and-qualifications.1487723/">Qualify</a> for those jobs in the first place, so relying solely on Wealth for Education Access could severely limit your country’s social mobility and opportunity for economic growth. This is where your school system comes in.  </p>
<p>The main source of Education Access comes from the Education Institution, which must be established by a Law and can be run by either the religious authorities, the private sector, or by a public administration depending on your school system Law. Each of these systems have their advantages: a religious school system keeps your priesthood strong and helps ensure unity of faith; a private school system works just peachy for Pops with high Wealth levels and ensures the working class don’t get strange ideas; and a public school system lets you enact mandatory schooling for children and encourages cultural assimilation.  </p>
<p>A country’s Literacy is simply the percentage of their Pops in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-16-states.1491897/">Incorporated</a> states that know how to read and write at any given point. This means that if the most educated people in your society decide they’ve had enough and move abroad, your average Literacy will drop, to the benefit of the other country. If a war utterly devastates the backwaters of your nation and slaughters the hundreds of thousands you conscripted to defend it, your average Literacy might increase.  </p>
<p><em>After the Texan Revolutionary War, these Clerks found themselves once again subjects of Mexico. While they currently all know how to read and write, their offspring are unlikely to enjoy the same benefits. Mexico has no formal school system in place and their Wealth doesn’t buy much of an education. To add insult to injury the Catholic Church Interest Group in Mexico is currently spreading Pious Fiction to ensure the children aren’t led astray by heretical ideas. The next generation of Clerks are unlikely to qualify to follow in their parents’ footsteps.</em>  </p>

<p>​All technology is organised into <em>Eras</em>, which are rough estimates of progress through the game’s timespan. Anything in Era I is considered pre-1836 technology, going back as far as the very idea of <em>Rationalism</em> to the invention of <em>Steelworking</em>. Era II ranges from the start of the game to around the 1860s - <em>Railways</em> and <em>Percussion Cap</em> ammunition both belong here (though some countries did have railways a little earlier than 1836; this is not an exact science). Era III runs from the early 1860s to the end of the 1880s, and includes <em>Civilizing Mission</em> as a justification for colonisation and <em>Pumpjacks</em>, heralding the rise of the oil industry. Era IV from late 1880 to the early 20th century includes both <em>War Propaganda</em> and <em>Film</em>, both which might make it easier to justify the horrors which are to come in Era V - including <em>Battleships</em>, <em>Chemical Warfare</em>, and <em>Stormtroopers</em>. Era V also sees truly modern civilian inventions such as the <em>Oil Turbine</em> to make Electricity from Oil and <em>Paved Roads</em> to improve your national infrastructure.  </p>
<p>The Eras act as an indicator of roughly where you are at in a given tree, but also serves a role in ensuring that rushing a certain late-game technology is difficult. Not only do technologies in later Eras take more innovative effort to research, but each technology you have not yet researched in that tree from previous Eras makes it harder and harder to make progress. This means techs aren’t unlocked on specific years in Victoria 3, and there is never a hard block preventing you from making your Universities develop technologies earlier than they were historically invented. But keep in mind that it’s a less efficient use of time and resources, so ensure that acquiring that technology ahead of everyone else is actually crucial for your strategy, as it will not come easily.  </p>
<p><em>Trying to take a shortcut from the Atmospheric Engine (Era I) through Water-tube Boiler (II) and Rotary Valve Engine (III) straight to Combustion Engine (IV) so you’re able to manufacture Automobiles in the mid-1800s is certainly possible given enough money and grit, but would be far from the best use of your resources. Even skipping a few Era III Production techs before going for the Combustion Engine could easily yield this 30% time penalty, the difference which might buy you a whole Era III tech. Besides, you might want to research Rubber Mastication and set up a few Rubber Plantations before you start building Automobiles, unless you want your factories to be wholly dependent on foreign rubber for the tires...</em>  </p>

<p>​The final yet crucial point about technological development is that government funding and steering of national research is not the dominant way most countries are exposed to new ideas. For each of the three categories of technology (Production, Military, and Society) there is always one technology that is <em>spreading</em> in your country. Which exact tech that spreads to you in each category is out of your hands, but it will always be something in your current technological Era which has already been invented elsewhere.  </p>
<p>The speed by which technology spreads to you is highly dependent on your population’s Literacy. In addition, any Innovation you generate in excess of the Literacy cap is funnelled into improving tech spread rate. In other words, oversizing your Universities compared to your school system can assist in <em>catching up</em> to the rest of the world but can never be used to <em>get ahead</em> of the others.  </p>
<p><em>Technology spread is also affected by your Freedom of Speech Laws. Stricter censorship provides you with more Authority but hinders the assimilation of new knowledge throughout your country. This is often to your detriment but could also very well be exactly what you intended! The downside of having a well-educated population is that they get exposed to foreign ideas more easily, and some of those ideas might not be what you had in mind. A bit more state control over what people are allowed to talk about can help keep your population focused on the ideas you want them to know about.</em>  </p>

<p>​The technology system in Victoria 3 is meant to shape and change the game as your campaign evolves. While a few techs apply straight bonuses to various attributes of your country, the primary function of most techs is to unlock new actions, options, and even challenges. Very often, discovering a new technology doesn’t have any immediate effect on your country but gives you new ways to run your country and new tools in your toolbox. The introduction of new inventions and ideas can also act as a catalyst for emerging situations in your country, with certain parts of your populace demanding these new developments be adopted - or shunned. Much of this is driven by the Journal system which we will talk more about in a few weeks, but before that we will cover another feature of crucial importance to grand strategy games - Flags! See you next week!</p>

<p>I remember it being mentioned before that new military tech just increases the original production quantity (i.e there are no Rifles, just small arms), which was a bit disappointing, but I assume from this it means that I discover rifling, my factories produce more of the same small arms after I change its production, but then my military changes its "production" to "Rifles" which increases its combat power at the cost of more small arms. Then when I discover bolt action rifles, it's the same deal; I expend more small arms, my units consume more small arms, but use the production type "bolt action rifles" and fight much better on the battlefield with the same quantity of manpower. Is this line of thinking correct?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You discover Bolt Action Rifles, your Arms Industries can now make more effective firearms, meaning your existing army becomes cheaper <em>or</em> you export the excess and make your Arms Industries richer <em>or</em> you upgrade your infantry or specialist corps (which might require <em>other</em> techs) to use more firepower, making them more effective.</p>

<p>Can we cue research? This would help to avoid having a 'save' up research points mechanic and would generally make life easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At present, no - this would actually be a pretty sizeable feature since it'd have to recursively compute which techs are prerequisites (since the trees can get quite complex), manage and display the queue, alter the order of the research queue automatically if certain techs become cheaper to research (due to e.g. tech spread), different UI considerations (since you can select any tech, not just the ones that "light up" as available), etc.  </p>
<p>It's also of lesser importance to have a save-up-points mechanic since excess Innovation goes towards the techs spreading to you, so you're not wasting your output if you don't immediately select the next tech.</p>

<p>The Eureka concept in the Civ 6 tech system is interesting, since it boosts research in logical things that the civilization excels at.  </p>
<p>Have you considered a similiar mechanic, making for example research in steel production technologies more effective if you have a strong steel industry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We actually considered and discarded the Eureka concept for V3 very early on. It'd be trivial to do in our engine, what we didn't like about it is that it felt like putting the cart before the horse, and constrained creativity: rather than me inventing the Bessemer Method because I need more Steel, I build more Steel Mills so I'll get a discount to researching the Bessemer Method, so I wouldn't be "wasting" my research. Presumably the increased focus on Steel I get from this process now makes it cheaper for me to get some other Steel-production-related tech, so now it feels bad to go research something in a different field where I don't qualify for a discount, etc.  </p>
<p>The connection between what a country <em>knows</em> and what a country <em>does</em> already comes naturally from the other direction - if I need more Steel, I research a better way of making Steel, then I implement that. My Steel Mills are now more effective and more of my economy will start to rely on Steel. Maybe my next invention will be in Trade so I can leverage this Steel power globally, or in Artillery production so I can make use of the Steel in my domestic armaments production. I prefer if players are free to think in those terms rather than in what hoops they now have to jump through to get the best bonuses next time. The main issue is with the AI, ensuring it doesn't make too harebrained decisions and research garbage that doesn't benefit them and has nothing to do with their strategy, but that issue should be dealt with in AI programming - not short circuited via artificial reward systems - in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to mod current literacy as a modifier?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current literacy is already a "modifier" in the sense that progression towards Education Access is gradual by definition; the higher the current Literacy the longer it takes to drop to a lower level, since it's modeled via birth and death rates (meaning also that the higher the Pop's Standard of Living, the longer their life expectancy, and therefore the longer current rates stick around). Sure, we could make it adjust Education Access as well, but all that'd do in practice is add more inertia and make the values that factor into it harder to understand.</p>

<p>It will entirely depend on how fast it actually drops in practice, but if it goes from 100% literacy to 4% literacy in a generation(somewhat insinuated but could also just be generalized language in the image caption) that seems like too fast of a drop, even for the poor and propagandized. And I don't feel like wealth fully captures the ability of the already educated to pass that knowledge on.  </p>
<p>Thanks for the answer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, poor choice of words on my part! The next generation of Clerks - i.e. all Pop growth from this point on - would indeed have only 4% Literacy, but this Pop growth happens gradually over time, so the length of time required to make the entire Pop only 4% Literacy would be equal to the time required to replace every individual member of that Pop - so maybe 30-40 years or so at least? About 1/3rd to 1/2 the total running time of the game. Longer than that if at higher Standard of Living (even disregarding the boost in Education Access that would inherently provide) and shorter if lower.</p>

<p>Vicky 3 unironically has one of the worst looking tech trees I have ever seen in a video game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're aware that the tech tree is a bit visually underwhelming right now, and we have set aside time to work on the visuals further before release. The explanation for why it looks the way it does at the moment might be a little contentious, but getting a peek at how the sausage is made is the whole point of dev diaries, so I assume it might at least be interesting even if you end up not agreeing with our reasoning.  </p>
<p>When developing the tech tree, we did not start out the way many other games do, by creating a visually pleasing and symmetric empty layout and connections that meshed with the pacing we wanted the game to have, only to later plug in the content we thought might fit well there. Instead we started in the other end, by working out the kinds of techs we wanted to represent in the game and then create the logical connections between them, which then generates the layout and visual connections automatically.  </p>
<p>This machine-computed layout is not going to be as pretty as a human could potentially make it, and we briefly considered moving to a model of static positioning to improve it. But we resisted and eventually discarded this idea in favor of making incremental improvements to the visuals of a machine-computed layout instead, for two very connected reasons:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We don't want layout and visuals to constrain game design or production - if we think it would improve the game to wedge another tech into Era 3 with a couple of additional prerequisites, we don't want that idea blocked because it'd be expensive to redraw the tree and the art team thinks it'd be hard to make it look as good. We want a development flow where a designer can decide a new tech is needed, spend a few minutes scripting that tech in, add a placeholder icon for it, and start playing their prototype immediately, with the new icon being the only additional requirement which can be added whenever the art department gets around to it.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wanted to ensure the tech trees were as easily moddable as humanly possible, since tech has enormous potential for modding which is often hamstrung by UI constraints. This flexibility also helps us in expanding and maintaining the game long-term.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Visual appeal does take a backseat to those concerns (within reason, of course), but as mentioned we have every intention to continue improving the look and feel of the tech trees beyond what is in the game currently.</p>

<p>​Hi folks, welcome to another dev diary, and get hyped for what I know you're longing for: <em>flags</em>. I'm Ofaloaf, one of the designers on the game, and somehow they let me write a dev diary. Let's go!  </p>
<p>Let's start at the beginning. What is a flag?  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/20211201_103509_sm.jpg"><img alt="20211201_103509_sm.jpg" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/20211201_103509_sm.jpg" title="20211201_103509_sm.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: TUEBOR pluridus Du QuMId&gt; c</font></p>
<p><em>A flag is a thing of beauty.</em><br />
​A flag is a decorative design on a bit of fabric, often used to communicate something, such as a message or identity, to the viewer. In Victoria 3, all flags are flags associated with countries. They're neat designs that serve as visual shorthand for a state, and they just look pretty too, most of the time.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/orange%20free%20state.PNG"><img alt="orange free state.PNG" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/orange%20free%20state.PNG" title="orange free state.PNG" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>​In the Victorian era, what counts as <em>the</em> flag of a country was a bit… vague, depending on who you were asking. Some countries, like the United States and France, very clearly had a single flag that served as <em>the</em> national flag that everybody knew them by, but others weren't so clear.   </p>
<p>Look - here's some period examples of what people considered Russia's flag to be:  </p>
<p><em>Selection from 'The maritime flags of all nations', 1832, as seen on Wikimedia Commons</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/The_maritime_flags_of_all_nations%2C_1832_%28FOL_LA_ROQ_1542_NOR%29_croppo.jpg"><img alt="The_maritime_flags_of_all_nations,_1832_(FOL_LA_ROQ_1542_NOR)_croppo.jpg" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/The_maritime_flags_of_all_nations%2C_1832_%28FOL_LA_ROQ_1542_NOR%29_croppo.jpg" title="The_maritime_flags_of_all_nations,_1832_(FOL_LA_ROQ_1542_NOR)_croppo.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><em>Selection from 'Pavillons et cocardes des principales puissances du globe d'apres des documens officials', 1850, as seen in the David Rumsey Map Collection.</em>  </p>

<p>​First thing that's noticeable is that <em>it's not just one flag</em>. The tricolor that is used as the Russian Federation's flag now was just one of several in use in the 19th century up through to the 1850s, as a merchant flag or civil ensign used to identify civilian ships in foreign ports. The Romanov dynasty's emblem is also used as a Russian flag, and then there's two naval jacks - the flags with the blue saltires or diagonal crosses stretching across them- which are also widely recognized. Eventually, the Russian government started trying to consolidate everything and issued a decree on June 23rd, 1858, proclaiming a single "state flag", a black-gold-white tricolor. In 1883, the white-blue-red "merchant" flag was officially accepted as a national flag to be used on special occasions, and in 1896 it wholly replaced the black-gold-white tricolor as Russia's state flag.  </p>
<p>Man, ain't that a doozy of flags to pick from! How are we supposed to pick which one to use in Victoria 3? Well, good news there - we can use more than one flag! We got dynamic flags triggered by script!  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/russianflags.png"><img alt="russianflags.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/russianflags.png" title="russianflags.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>​Any trigger which is valid for a country, like checking if a specific state is owned by the player or if a war is happening, can be used to trigger a different flag in the game. We've used that to spice up flag varieties in different situations - for example, a united Scandinavian monarchy has a different flag depending on whether the Danes are in charge or not:  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/scandinavia.png"><img alt="scandinavia.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/scandinavia.png" title="scandinavia.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>​Spicy! And that's on top of just using the usual checks like governments, the number of states in a country, and so forth - right, yes, you probably want to see the stars in the American flag, don't you? I know I do. They do change based on the number of states in the Union.  </p>
<p><em>I can taste the freedom.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/freedom.png"><img alt="freedom.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/freedom.png" title="freedom.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: +tttt TTtt 1tttt Ttt</font></p>
<p>​There's even some unique flags for when one country becomes the puppet of another. In some cases, a generic "oh no I am a puppet now" design is used for the puppeted country's flag with the "master" country's flag inserted as a canton in the upper-left corner of the puppeted country's flag, while in other cases a wholly unique flag is made for a particular combination of puppeteer and puppet.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/puppeteer%20and%20puppet.png"><img alt="puppeteer and puppet.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/puppeteer%20and%20puppet.png" title="puppeteer and puppet.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>​There's also a sort of fallback system, to provide flags for every polity even if we can't really settle on one particular design, or if they're feisty dynamic rebels, or what-have-you. Flags can be randomly generated, with particular triggers set so some flag elements only appear if a tag is of a particular culture, religion, or ideology, among other things.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/randomflags.png"><img alt="randomflags.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2328%20-%20Flags/randomflags.png" title="randomflags.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: </font></p>
<p>​And, for the modders out there, it shouldn't be difficult for you folks to put together more flags if you want (and of course you want to make more flags, right?) - we use a system similar to the one Crusader King 3 uses for its coats of arms. France's default flag is a simple example of how the system works:  </p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>```
FRA = {
    pattern = "pattern_solid.tga"
    color1 = "blue"</p>
<pre><code>colored_emblem = {
    texture = "ce_tricolor_vertical.dds"
    color1 = "white"
    color2 = "red"
}
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>All that's going on there is that a plain blue field is set as the background, and then a single graphical element with the central third and right third of the tricolor as colorable sections is slapped on top, with white and red respectively added in there to make a nice and tidy blue-white-red <em>tricolore</em>. Magnifique!  </p>
<p>And to plug that bad boy into the game, all you need is a little scripting in another file that goes a little something like this:  </p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p><code>FRA = { # France
    flag_definition = {
        coa = FRA
        subject_canton = FRA
        allow_overlord_canton = yes
        coa_with_overlord_canton = FRA_subject        
        priority = 1
    }
    flag_definition = {
        coa = FRA
        subject_canton = FRA
        allow_overlord_canton = yes        
        overlord_canton_scale = { 0.337 0.337 }            
        priority = 10
        trigger = { 
            coa_def_republic_flag_trigger = yes
        }
    }
    [And so forth. Find more flags by playing the game!]    
}</code></p>
<p>You can create as many flag definitions as you like, and you can plug the same flag design into multiple definitions or make a unique one for every definition if you want to go insane scripting it all up. Triggers are straightforward to plug in (and you can script generic triggers if you don't want to write the same combination of checks over and over again). If you want to mod flags, there's a <em>delightful</em> amount of flexibility with this system.  </p>
<p>So there you have it! We got flags. We got <em>lots</em> of flags! We got randomized combinations of flags that go on for days! You could script more flags if you really want to poke at the game's innards! <em>Flags</em>.  </p>
<p>Now, as we march towards the Holiday season, the dev diaries are taking a bit of a break. We will be back in January with a brand new topic in our first dev diary for 2022. Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year!</p>

<p>I'm curious about something, as the DD leaves it ambiguous, but does the US flag dynamically change the amount of and rescale the stars based directly on the amount of states or are there several flags defined? I assume the former because the later would be a ridiculous amount of work, but if the former, is this handled directly in the flag definition script or is some form of hidden event called everytime the amount of integrated states change to update the flag with new parameters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has one star per incorporated state, up to 100. Each flag variant uses the same graphical elements, while the layout of those elements is determined in script.</p>

<p>Without mods, your best shot for sticking to a design you like is sticking to the conditions that lead to that flag appearing. Modding has some flexibility because of how much can be triggered through script, but it'll have to be through mods.  </p>

<p>Hypothetical, I think. I don't actually remember all the triggers, but I knew the idea of war-specific flags would probably appeal to very specific sorts of flag posters and modders.</p>

<p>Can there ever be multiple nations which share a flag?</p>

<p>Yeah, that's quite doable. Looking at the France example in the first post, I could take another country (let's call it XYZ for the sake of an example) and make a flag definition like  </p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p><code>XYZ = { # Hyoptheticalland
    flag_definition = {
        coa = FRA
        subject_canton = FRA
        allow_overlord_canton = yes
        coa_with_overlord_canton = FRA_subject        
        priority = 1
    }
}</code></p>
<p>and it'd just... reference the same FRA flag design that France proper uses.</p>

<p>That is the case, yeah. The flag of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (Puritan! Born in 1599 and died in 1658 September! etc.), is the dictatorial republican flag, sans escutcheon, while the Chartist tricolor is still the democratic republican flag.</p>

<p>Yes. Forget the rigid V2 system where there are 4 regimes and 4 flags.  </p>
<p>In V3 some flags are very general and some are very specific. France for example can use the tricolour whether they are monarchist or republican, but maybe a particularly absolutist monarchy would adopt the ancient fleury banner.</p>

<p>Russia is one of those countries that we went into a little more detail with. As a general rule for flavour, absolute monarchies are represented with the historical personal banner of the monarch ("I am the state"), which is why Russia starts in 1836 with the Tsar's yellow flag and not the tricolour. As you draw power away from the emperor, the Russian flag may develop into the modern one.</p>

<p>We've approached the idea that the Great Britain tag is fundamentally the union between Scotland and England (both of which exist as separate tags), and so Scottish elements will not leave the flag.   </p>

<p>​Hello, my name is Henrik and I am a UX Designer on PDS. I have been a part of the Victoria 3 team for almost the entirety of the project, and since I am about to take a few months of parental leave I wanted to leave you with a brief summary and overview of the thoughts and ideas that form the foundation of the User Experience (UX) design in our game. Also, say hello to Aron whom I have written this dev diary in cooperation with. Aron has been my UX padawan for the past year and will be shouldering the UX while I am gone.  </p>
<p>First and foremost, why do we do what we do? Basically, our end goal is to make the game more approachable and accessible, so that we can make it <strong>even deeper</strong> and <strong>more complex</strong>. Complexity should not come from not knowing where to find something and why something happened, but from the deep simulation and game mechanics at the core of our game. The more accessible the information and interactions can be, the more complex we can make that information and those interactions.  </p>
<p>In order to get there, we have three UX Pillars  </p>
<ol>
<li>The right information at the right time</li>
<li>Clear feedback about cause and effect</li>
<li>Clearly separate Actions from Information</li>
</ol>
<p>What tools do we have at our disposal to provide a user experience that satisfies these lofty goals? In this Dev Diary we will walk you through some of our main tools and approaches.  </p>
<h2>Nested tooltip, as made famous by Crusader Kings 3​</h2>
<p>There is one piece of technology we can not see this game without: Nested Tooltips. We use it both for Game Concepts, and for getting more detailed breakdowns of numbers, and boy do we have numbers! This allows us to achieve parts of the first UX Pillar, <em>The Right information</em> <em>at the right time</em>. Instead of having to explain every single detail and anecdote in a single humongous tooltip, we can focus on the most essential and important information for the current context and leave any information that might not be directly tied to this context for the nested tooltips to cover. This is crucial in Victoria 3 where every single thing affects a whole bunch of other things, some very important and others simply knock on effects.  </p>

<p><em>Of course Nested Tooltips come with their own set of challenges. This is where we are happy to allow for a lot of customization and tweaking. For example, how do you want the tooltip to lock? Mouse Tendency, Timer Lock, or Action Lock? If you choose the Timer Lock, how long do you want that timer to be? Etc.</em>  </p>

<p>​Another thing we show in these tooltips is the next thing on the agenda and what y’all been waiting for - graphs!  </p>
<h2>Data visualization​</h2>
<p>One of the more challenging areas is to clearly give feedback of a value’s <em>change over time</em>. In a game with as many interlocking systems as Victoria, giving feedback on how something has changed over time becomes an essential part of the game-loop. How can we take several values and show you exactly how it has changed over time? You guessed it, line graphs.  </p>

<h2>​Numbers that update in real time and Predictions​</h2>
<p>In most cases in our previous games, you have to tick the game in order to see the effects of things. In Victoria, we try to make all the immediate effects of your actions available the second you take them. When taking actions that have consequences spreading far and wide throughout the game's systems, it can be really hard to parse if this is a good idea or not without excessive use of spreadsheet software. So we predict things for you. (With a nested tooltip breakdown of that prediction value of course!)  </p>
<p><em>The Building panel provides you with all the raw building data you could ever need, for you to analyze however you like. For whatever action you may desire, we provide our warmest support in your calculating endeavors with predictions such as the Weekly Balance when changing Production Method and predicted Earnings of the building if you were to expand it.</em>  </p>

<h2>​Focus on the Map​</h2>
<p>Our map is gorgeous and we want to put more emphasis on it. For example, all Events in the game have a location on the Map, and if you hover over a State name in any text, that State will be highlighted on the Map. This makes it easier to connect the names of things with their representation on the map, giving context to the text and the map. However, one of the coolest contextual information we are creating are Map Modes. We have Map Modes connected to most of our information panels, triggering when you open each panel which gives you the right contextual information at the right time. With the use of icons, numbers, and different heatmaps, we enable you to see several layers of contextual information at the same time without things getting too cluttered and without you having to scroll through a big sheet of data. Albeit, all Map Modes also exist in list form, making it possible to sort the information that is shown on the map, not entirely unlike a visual Ledger.  </p>

<h2>​Right-Click menus​</h2>
<p>The Map Interactions in the Lenses are our take on the Macro Builder, that is when you know what action you want to take and then you select what type of entity to perform that action on. On the other side of the coin, we use Right-Click menus for when you know what entity you want to perform an action on and then select an action from a list of potential actions. We have this for States, Markets, Characters, Buildings, Interest Groups and Goods. So any time you see any of those in the game, you can right-click on them to get a list of actions you can perform.  </p>

<h2>Empty States​</h2>
<p>Often forgotten, but extremely important. This is the feedback of dead ends, such as looking at the Urban Buildings tab of a State with no Urban Buildings. A useful empty state will let the player know what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what to do about it. In a State with no Urban Buildings we should of course tell this to the player, but also include the potential Urban Buildings which the player can build in that State. This is only one of many examples and you’d be surprised how often this simple yet important UX design aspect is forgotten. The empty state tells the player what that screen could be populated with and what the player can do about it.   </p>

<h2>​Should you get an economics degree before you play V3?​</h2>
<p>Far be it from us to ever discourage anyone from getting an economics degree! Yet, despite Victoria 3's immense depth and complexity, our intention is still to allow you to learn even the most advanced concepts the game is based on as you play. One aspect of this is the tutorial, which we are putting more focus onto than ever before and will cover in detail in a future Dev Diary. Another aspect is through tooltippable Game Concepts, which work much like an integrated dictionary or rule book. Whenever you see such a Concept in text, such as Pops, Dividends Taxes, or Market Price, you can tooltip it to get an explanation of what it means and references to related concepts and mechanics. This powerful tool together with the Nested Tooltips allows us to design and explain anything in the game without writing a novel in each tooltip, and as a player, you can choose to deep dive into any peculiarities as you see fit.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the DD. A few questions come to mind.  </p>
<p>1-When plotting line graphs, can we choose te time interval? Are we going to be able to see a graph showing the evolution of GDP, for instance, from 1836 to 1936?  </p>
<p>2-When using the lenses to build factories or other economic buildings, can we see the predicted economic impact of those actions?  </p>
<p>3-It is possible to know the amount of people living in a city or only it’s size?  </p>
<p>If you can answer at least some of these questions I would be thankful. The UX looks really great.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>As of right now, the interval is usually set from the beginning of the game, with either daily, weekly, or monthly sampling. However, some graphs make more sense to have shorter intervals on and for those we have that, although there are constant ongoing tweaks and improvements on this. Customizability of this is on our roadmap. As for your second question: For GDP, we do have the interval from the beginning of the game as you can see in the screenshot, so, yes you will be able to see a graph with your evolution of your GDP.</li>
<li>Yes, the predicted Earnings of you building or expanding a building will be in the tooltip of that action, regardless if you do it through the panels or on the map through the lenses.</li>
<li>Tagging in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/669315/">@lachek</a> to answer this one! - "While Population numbers are state-based, we know which Pops work in which buildings and we know which buildings belong to which cities. At the moment we don't slice the data such that you can see how many people live in what city since it doesn't do anything for gameplay, but we're looking into ways of visualizing this breakdown of state populations as well."</li>

<p>I really like this DD overall, except this image. This kind of visualization always give me more questions than answers and just piss me off overall. Why GDP is yearly if the graph show weakly? Why Y axis goes 36.6K? What is the two date? Why there is no horizontal or vertical lines helping me measure. Why there is no more data on the X,Y axis? Why not zoomed in when half the Y axis empty?  </p>
<p>I can't see the context of the image, therefore maybe i totally wrong and i obviously biased by other games so take my comment with a pinch of salt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This graph shows the GDP from the beginning of the game to the current in-game date, which means you can at least get a hum of how your GDP has changed over time. Graphs are a constant work in progress and we have it in our roadmap to be able to hover on any point in the graph and display the date and data of that point. Regarding the graph not filling up all the way, that is currently not working as designed, it should fill up all the way.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 30 USER INTERFACE OVERVIEW</font>
Hello all! My name is Kenneth and I am the 2D Art Lead on Victoria 3. Working on the game’s user interface (UI in short) with my team is a big part of what I do on the game. From here on, whenever the word UI is mentioned, it refers to an overview of these 3 categories (Panels, Buttons and Icons) which make up the UI of the game! The majority of the information and the decisions a player makes happens in the UI.   </p>
<p>There is a huge opportunity to engage and immerse the player into the world of Victoria 3 through the UI. As mentioned in the previous Dev Diary, the UX team’s focus is to make this massive amount of information approachable and accessible. Us, in the UI team, work extremely closely with them, to display all that information in a visually appealing way.   </p>
<p><strong>Art Pillars and how it ties with UI</strong>  </p>
<p>We have 3 core pillars for Victoria 3’s art style. These pillars guide the overall art direction and capture the feelings we want to convey in the game which includes of course, the UI!   </p>
<p><strong>Prestigious</strong>  </p>
<p>The UI is inspired by the extravagance and luxuries of the upper class in the Victorian era. It should feel elegant and exquisite.  </p>
<p><strong>Vintage and Idyllic</strong>  </p>
<p>Vintage here means something from the past that is of high quality. The Romanticism Art movement is a source of inspiration for the art direction. It seems fitting given that it originated in the 1800s and the idealisation of the idyllic past and nature fits in nicely with the Vintage feel that we want to incorporate in the UI.  </p>
<p><strong>Detailed yet Approachable</strong>  </p>
<p>High level of detail with intricate elements but used sparingly so it does not become cluttered and overwhelming.  </p>
<p><strong>UI panels</strong>  </p>
<p>UI panels form the base or background of every single UI menu (be it, fullscreen, popups, or on the sides) in the game. If it’s not on the map, it's on an UI panel.  </p>
<p>We chose to incorporate Art Nouveau elements into the panels. Art Nouveau is primarily inspired by nature and the natural forms and curves of plants and flowers. This aligns with the Art pillar <em>Vintage and idyllic</em>. The style is also prominent in the architecture of the upper echelons of society in the 1800s. It’s intricate details evoke a feeling of extravagance and elegance which aligns with the other two art pillars. We need to be careful not to put in too many detailed patterns as this will distract the main function of an UI: which is to display information to the player! Hence, we focus the rich details on frames and borders of the panels as well as headers where the title of the menu resides.  </p>
<p>*This is an UI panel. Elaborate patterns with a touch of gold and faded fabric textures   </p>
<p>adds that extra layer of prestige and vintage feel prominent in the Victorian era.*  </p>

<p>​<strong>Buttons</strong>  </p>
<p>Buttons are the main elements in the game and UI that the player interacts directly with. From the UX point of view, players would need to identify the buttons almost instantaneously. Buttons should be identified either as Navigation buttons (buttons that lead you to another UI screen) or Action buttons (buttons that perform an action that affects the game world). With that in mind, we sought to create a template for the game’s buttons while aligning it with our core art pillars.   </p>
<p>We use wood as a texture for the buttons for the aged, vintage feel. All buttons have an emerald colour with two different shades to differentiate between Action and Navigation buttons.  </p>
<p>*Different shades of emerald for the buttons. Action buttons also have a thin gold border   </p>
<p>to differentiate them further while still having both types recognised as buttons.*  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%202.png"><img alt="DD30 2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%202.png" title="DD30 2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Button text Button text</font></p>
<p>There would be some UI screens that would have multiple buttons on them. How can we draw attention to higher priority buttons (if any)? Our solution: Give them a more <em>‘prestigious’</em> look, by adding Art Nouveau elements around the borders and corners of the button!  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%203.png"><img alt="DD30 3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%203.png" title="DD30 3.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Button text</font></p>
<p>​<strong>Icons</strong>  </p>
<p>Icons are a major part of the UI of Paradox games and of course, this is no different in Victoria 3. Icons in the game come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, styles and colours, and we use them to represent a host of different things, mechanics, statistics and attributes in the game. I will break down some of the different ways in which we use the icons and hopefully y’all will gain a better insight into our design process.  </p>
<p><strong>Buildings and Goods</strong>  </p>
<p>This group of icons are by far, the most visual and detailed in the game. They are representations of actual things in the game world. These icons are akin to mini illustrations and their primary purpose is to enhance immersion and fuel the imagination of our players.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%204.png"><img alt="DD30 4.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%204.png" title="DD30 4.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Building Icons Goods Icons</font></p>
<p><strong>Events, Technologies and Pop groups</strong>  </p>
<p><em>‘Academia’</em> and <em>‘Dynamite’</em> are both technologies that a player can research but one seems to be a little abstract while ‘Dynamite’ is an actual object in real life. How then, do we approach such icons as a group? For technology and event icons, we decided to use objects from the real world or several objects to represent them. Since most of these icons are going to be pretty big (for an icon), we decided to go for a highly detailed and realistic rendering to enhance immersion. It is pretty straightforward for a technology like <em>‘Dynamite’</em>. For <em>‘Protest’</em> events, we use something a little more symbolic like a hand holding a loudhailer.   </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%205.png"><img alt="DD30 5.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%205.png" title="DD30 5.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP 'Technologies . Events Icons Icons jistnict</font></p>
<p>​Pop groups are represented by our amazing character models and icons. Since the character models will be a tad hard to see when scaled down, we use icons to support them. The same guidelines apply when designing Pop icons. For example, ‘Machinists’ are represented by a wrench.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%206.png"><img alt="DD30 6.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%206.png" title="DD30 6.png" /></a></p>

<p>​The final group of icons I am going to talk about is a broad group which represents game mechanics, their categories, attributes and stats. These icons tend to show up in multiple different UI screens and are not very big (for an icon). They may need to appear in different sizes as well. Many of them would need to be recognisable when they are small. Therefore, we reduce the amount of details on these icons drastically and instead focus on a few choice colours and the silhouettes.  </p>
<p><em>Battalions appear in many different UI screens and in a variety of sizes.</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP</font></p>
<p>​We can also use colour coding on these icons to make them more recognisable. For example, we can have positive condition icons being green and negative condition icons being red.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%209.png"><img alt="DD30 9.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2330%20-%20User%20Interface%20Overview/DD30%209.png" title="DD30 9.png" /></a></p>

<p>​<em>‘Interest Groups (IG)’</em> icons are a more complex example of colour coding. Players may not immediately remember and understand all the colour coding within each sub category of icons but our hope is that this will get more familiar and identifiable over time. Other examples of this are the <em>‘Lens’</em> category icons.  </p>

<p>​<strong>Tutorial</strong>  </p>
<p>In the previous Dev Diary, Aron and Henrik have briefly mentioned the tutorial. I am going to talk a little about the art that goes into helping players understand our incredibly deep and complex mechanics better. We believe that the combination of tooltips, text explanations and infographics will help visualise the game mechanics better. Most infographics you find online (go ahead, do a Google search) have a clean, stylised and very modern look. We see an opportunity here to make it fit with the Victorian era better. This can definitely be an area where immersion is enriched and of course, strengthen our art pillars. We took inspiration from newspaper illustrations and blueprint illustrations of the Victorian era and adopted it for our infographics. And as icing on the cake, we overlaid the drawings on top of an aged paper background.  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 31 JOURNAL ENTRIES</font></p>
<p>​Hello and welcome to this week’s Victoria 3 development diary! My name is Daniel and I’m the Content Design Lead for the project. Today we’ll be taking a first look at Journal Entries.  </p>
<p><em>Upon the death of King William IV, the personal union between Great Britain and Hanover ended due to different laws of succession. Queen Victoria ascended the British throne, while Hanover was ruled by William’s brother Ernest Augustus. This Journal Entry highlights the imminent end of the union.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%201.png"><img alt="DD31 1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%201.png" title="DD31 1.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: THE HANOVERIAN ~SUCCESSION The personal union between Great Britain and Hanover rests upon unstable ground: Different laws of succession guarantee that the union will end upon the death of King William, with the British throne passing to Princess Victoria: Will complete if: William of Hanover has died King</font></p>
<p>​Compared to Victoria 2 we’ve shifted the focus of scripted content away from random event popups and towards the Journal system. Journal Entries fulfill a variety of narrative and mechanical purposes in Victoria 3 - they can be optional goals the player can pursue, imminent disasters, anchors for ongoing situations, and much more. You can think of the Journal as items on the government’s agenda, situations that you can engage with (or not) to whatever extent best fits your goals and situation.  </p>
<p><em>In 1836 Canada was administered by several colonial governments, including Upper Canada (modern Ontario), Lower Canada (modern Quebec), and the Hudson’s Bay Company. By the end of our period they were consolidated into a single Canadian nation.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%202.png"><img alt="DD31 2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%202.png" title="DD31 2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Potential Journal Entries Confederate Canada Confederate Canada Will activate if: XHas researched Nationalism ' technology If completed: Federate Australia Triggers the Event Canadian Confederation Call Women' $ Suffrage for</font></p>
<p>​Here we can see some potential entries in the British Journal. Inactive Journal Entries serve to announce potential goals you might want to pursue or disasters you might want to avoid, depending on what you’re aiming to do with your country. Many Journal Entries have an effect upon activation, usually an event presenting the situation to the player both narratively and mechanically, and sometimes offering different approaches to the issue. The Confederate Canada Journal Entry leads you as a colonial overlord down the path of consolidating your Canadian subjects into a single nation. To begin this process you’ll need to research Nationalism, but there are also hidden triggers that determine whether this should appear in your Journal as a possibility at all. In this case the Journal Entry is potentially available for any country that has Canadian subjects; this means that this content is not exclusive to Great Britain, but available to any country that fits the bill.   </p>
<p>This is reflective of our goals for historical content in Victoria 3. We want to avoid arbitrary historical events that occur for specific countries even when they don’t make sense in relation to what’s happening in the game. We also want to avoid writing content that only happens for particular state actors under hyper-specific conditions, making it all but invisible. So historical content should be both emergent and visible to the greatest extent possible.  </p>
<p><em>The Ottoman Empire was in a period of steep decline by 1836. Despite attempts to modernize the country, it was not able to retain its dominance and fell to the wayside of history, eventually collapsing to nationalist movements and the machinations of the great powers. In Victoria 3, you have the opportunity to steer history in a different direction. How would an Ottoman resurgence affect the world?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%203.png"><img alt="DD31 3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%203.png" title="DD31 3.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Active Journal Entries The Sick Man of Europe The Sick Man of Europe Will complete if: 100% Complete 4 'Tanzimat' Journal Entries Will time out in 20 years Tanzimat: Urbanization If completed: Triggers the Event Tanzimat: The Reorganization Tanzimat: Education Reform If time runs out: 100% Istanbul Triggers the Event The Dead Man of Europe Tanzimat: Suppress Separatism 100% Tanzimat: Modernization Army</font></p>
<p>​Though we certainly do have nation-specific content. Above we can see that the Ottomans are dealing with The Sick Man of Europe Journal Entry series. There are quite a few features a Journal Entry can have. Progress bars can track completion (or failure!) of Journal Entries based on specific variables. Journal Entries can also have a timeout, which might have an effect when it expires, in this case a very negative consequence for failing to reform the country. In other Journal Entries we use timeouts to create limited-time opportunities you can take advantage of if you’re willing to commit to a goal. Additionally, there are pulses that can be added to Journal Entries that have effects on a monthly/weekly/yearly basis, and we can use these to, for example, measure that a set of objectives has been true for a certain amount of time. All of this is entirely written in our scripting language and is therefore extremely moddable.  </p>
<p><em>Following the end of the Sakoku era and Shogunate rule, Japan modernized rapidly. A major transformation of society and the economy proceeded, and the great powers watched with interest. Will you be able to guide Japan towards a prosperous future, striking the balance between modernization and sovereignty?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%204.png"><img alt="DD31 4.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%204.png" title="DD31 4.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: American Military Consultants Event in Kanto Taking interest in Japan' modernization efforts, United States of America has offered us the service of General Zachary Taylor as a military consultant. The terms of this arrangement appear favorable, but we should be wary of indebting ourselves to foreign powers. "This, sir, is a Gatling gun: Two hundred rounds per mninute: There is nothing neither mnan nor beast nor machine, that can withstand the hellish cacophony of ammunition that this device can unleash. We will teach your soldiers to operate such mnachines, to maintain modern mnilitary discipline, and to their superiors without question: We welcome American assistance. We do not want their 'poisoned chalice: obey</font></p>
<p>​While a Journal Entry is active, various events might occur in your nation. Here for instance a modernizing Japan considers an offer of American military consultancy. Active Journal Entries might also unlock Decisions - one-time actions a country can opt to take - or have a multitude of effects and modifiers while they remain in play.  </p>
<p><em>The Great Molasses Flood of 1919 saw the city of Boston inundated with treacle due to a burst storage tank. Investing in the safety of your industries is important if you wish to avoid such accidents becoming commonplace.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%205.png"><img alt="DD31 5.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2331%20-%20Journal%20Entries/DD31%205.png" title="DD31 5.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Raleigh The Great Molasses Flood Location: North Carolina Time remaining: 90 days</font></p>
<p>​On the topic of events, there are now extremely few “pop-up” events that immediately demand the player’s attention. Events now appear both in the outliner and on the map itself, and can be opened and minimized at your convenience.  </p>
<p>Journal Entries are a dynamic and versatile system used to represent a wide variety of era-inspired situations and historical content, and to make the game world feel narratively alive. The possibilities for this system are practically limitless and I expect we’ll continue to innovate with it for a long time to come - and with its incredible degree of moddability I look forward to seeing the community’s own creations as well.  </p>
<p>That is all for today! Next month we’ll be donning our pith helmets and centering our development diaries on the theme of colonization and exploration.</p>

<p>Journal Entries don't always have completion conditions! In this case it serves as a reminder to the player that they will eventually lose Hanover. Behind the scenes we also use it to subtly ramp up the chances of King William dying, because it wouldn't be much of a Victoria game if Queen Victoria doesn't ascend the throne until 50 years into the game.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 32 COLONIZATION</font></p>
<p>Good evening and welcome to this week’s dev diary! Today’s topic is colonization, which in Victoria 3 terms means the process of establishing and expanding colonial states in regions owned by Decentralized nations.  </p>
<p><em>The pith helmet became popular among British forces following the Anglo-Sikh wars, being widely adopted in tropical regions. The helmet has become synonymous with 19th and 20th Century colonial conquests and expeditions.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD32%201.png"><img alt="DD32 1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD32%201.png" title="DD32 1.png" /></a></p>

<p>To establish colonies, you must have researched the Colonization technology, a tier 1 technology common to many recognized powers at game start. This unlocks Colonization laws as well as the Colonial Affairs Institution, which affects how quickly your colonies will grow.  </p>
<p><em>In 1884 the Berlin Conference initiated the Scramble for Africa. Hungry for new resources and global dominance, the great powers divided the continent between themselves and began a relentless campaign of conquest and colonization, establishing colonial governments to oversee their new domains.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD32%202.png"><img alt="DD32 2.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD32%202.png" title="DD32 2.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: 6 [ 89. 1 Y04, 3 Colonize Windward Coast 1 Baule Kru</font></p>
<p>You can establish colonies in strategic regions where you have <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-19-relations-and-infamy.1494496/">declared an Interest</a>, and within those strategic regions you can colonize a state region in which at least one state is controlled by a Decentralized nation. Once you’ve selected a location, one of the provinces in that state region will be the starting point for your colony. Having a colony in a state region does not give you a monopoly on it; other colonial powers can create competing colonies, resulting in split states and messy borders that are sure to generate diplomatic tensions in the future.  </p>
<p>Colonial States are a special kind of state that is created by establishing a colony in a Decentralized nation or conquering territory from an Unrecognized power. A Colonial State that borders a non-colonial state belonging to the same country will lose its colonial status and become a regular unincorporated state. Colonial States have a bonus to migration attraction and are affected by certain modifiers from colonial laws and the Colonial Affairs institution. Since Colonial States cannot be incorporated, your institutions do not apply there, and pops living in these states cannot be taxed and will have very little political power to contribute to <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Interest Groups</a>.  </p>
<p>Now, why would you want a colony? Primarily, you’d want colonies to gain access to more natural resources that you may be lacking at home, especially goods required for more advanced manufacturing Production Methods like rubber and dye. Once your colony expands enough that it’s the largest State in its State Region, it will become part of your <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-9-national-markets.1484917/">National Market</a>, giving you direct access to the goods it produces assuming that you ensure market access. Many European powers have little opportunity for aggressive expansion in their homelands, as wars there could become very unpredictable and destructive. And of course, any territory you don’t colonize yourself may fall into the hands of your rivals!  </p>
<p>*A handy progress bar lets you know how soon your colony will expand, with the corresponding tooltip and nested tooltip breaking down in increasing detail exactly why it is growing (or not growing!) at the current rate.  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD33%203.png"><img alt="DD33 3.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD33%203.png" title="DD33 3.png" /></a></p>

<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD33%204.png"><img alt="DD33 4.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2332%20-%20Colonization/DD33%204.png" title="DD33 4.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Ar Great Britain is generating 6.59% Colonial Growth from 16.50M incorporated population 0.40 per 1M people ) this is then split between colonies</font>*  </p>
<p>​The rate of Colonial Growth is determined by your incorporated population, and modified by your Colony Growth Generation Speed (primarily affected by your investment in Colonial Affairs) as well as by local conditions in the State Region.The more colonies you have growing at once, the less quickly each colony will develop, though you can selectively pause and resume Colonial Growth in a state. Once a colony grows, it will expand into neighboring provinces owned by a Decentralized nation within its state region.  </p>
<p>Early in the game, the colonization of most regions will be a very long and painful process due to the prevalence of malaria and other hostile conditions. The technology of the time did not allow the European colonial powers to penetrate far into Africa, but with the development of quinine and malaria prevention techniques this would cease to be the obstacle it once was. In Victoria 3, you will need to develop your medical technology and invest in your institutions to overcome harsh penalties to colonial growth in the most inhospitable regions.  </p>
<p>Now of course you can’t expect to claim and exploit vast swathes of land without some resistance from the people who live there. While a colony is growing, it has a chance to generate Tension with neighbouring Decentralized nations. If Tension rises too high, the Decentralized nation will begin a Native Uprising - a kind of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-21-diplomatic-plays.1495892/">Diplomatic Play</a> - against you to retake their homeland and expel the invaders. Tension will slowly decay, but on average you can expect the factors advancing Tension to eventually outweigh its decay rate. Though it is very likely that the native inhabitants will be technologically outmatched by a colonial power, there are some factors that give them a fighting chance. Firstly, the colonial power needs to manage the logistics of transporting an army to the region while the Decentralized nation has the home advantage. Secondly, other nations with an Interest in the region can join the Diplomatic Play on either side. If France, for instance, has their own designs for dominance over West Africa they might decide to support Kaabu in their struggle against British encroachment.  </p>
<p><em>Colonial laws are typically supported by the Armed Forces due to their Jingoist ideology, which causes them to advocate for an aggressive and expansionist foreign policy. The Industrialists, ever seeking new sources of profit, especially favor Colonial Exploitation, while the Rural Folk fear for their livelihoods if their agricultural jobs are replaced by cheap colonial labor.</em>  </p>
<p><img alt="3neT-frlXmAX3kEB8sw7ABgULE-BnLWuFAiJ4PlEOQXwYJEpM2Dz-Xx0xjwkAXeMAQ2wpEOfcHLXdorUEE7hzlZsuPGnIhYvvRJW_KOpI9aLEybOWe5qo4BMrEhStkTUhTayZV4Q" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3neT-frlXmAX3kEB8sw7ABgULE-BnLWuFAiJ4PlEOQXwYJEpM2Dz-Xx0xjwkAXeMAQ2wpEOfcHLXdorUEE7hzlZsuPGnIhYvvRJW_KOpI9aLEybOWe5qo4BMrEhStkTUhTayZV4Q" /></p>
<p>One of the most important factors affecting Tension decay is your colonial policy. Colonial powers can choose between Colonial Resettlement, which encourages migration to colonies, and Colonial Exploitation, which improves building throughput in colonial states at the expense of reduced Tension decay and Standard of Living for pops in those states.  </p>
<p>Let’s sum this up: once you have the appropriate technology and laws, you can start a colony in a Decentralized nation and it will slowly expand over time. The rate of growth is determined largely by your level of investment in Colonial Affairs and the population of your incorporated states. As your colonies grow, they generate Tension with nearby Decentralized nations which can eventually lead to a Native Uprising.  </p>
<p>Next week I’ll be handing you over to Ofaloaf of Monthly Update video fame, who will talk in more detail about the Decentralized nations of Victoria 3’s world map.</p>

<p>Colonial Resettlement improves your tension decay compared to Colonial Exploitation. We also have some content for the EIC and Dutch East Indies inspired by historical attempts to do, with heavy quotation marks, "ethical colonialism", but that's not related to the mechanic of colonizing decentralized nations.  </p>

<p>Can you give us some estimate how expensive colonizing and maintaining colonies is? Do you need large/medium size economy to do that, or is it feasible for minors as well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's correct, colony growth is based on province-by-province expansion into a state region.  </p>
<p>The economic cost is represented by the cost of maintaining the Government Administrations that generate the Bureaucracy used to invest in the Colonial Affairs Institution. This is scaled to your population, which is good for small countries because they can invest about as easily as a large country, but also bad because the impact is also scaled to your incorporated population, meaning small countries ultimately still colonize at a slower rate.  </p>

<p>The military role of colonial expansion is represented partially by the need to respond with force to native uprisings in decentralized nations, and partially by invasions of the centralized countries in Africa. More on which countries are which next week!  </p>

<p>What limits are there on how many colonies you can start at once? Is it cost restricting it or some sort of hard cap number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can start as many colonies as you like, but your total growth will be split between each colony. So starting a large number of colonies will make each one grow painfully slowly, which increases the time until you're able to add the state to your national market, increases the chance of generating tension, and leaves more time for your rivals to start up a competing colony.</p>

<p>Right, I'm going to jump in with some clarifications about Colonial States here (and my bad for missing this when reviewing the DD internally): The old design worked exactly as <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/352223/">@neondt</a> outlined, but we recently made some changes. Specifically, we unified the concepts of Colonial and Unincorporated States (as the line between colony and territory is more than a little blurry) and we made it possible to Incorporate any State, though with a varying amount of time and resource investment based on cultural ties (while a State is being Incorporated, you pay all the costs for it and receive only partial benefits). Sorry for the confusion!</p>

<p>There's no longer a distinction between Colonial State and Unincorporated State, so no, this isn't a thing. Whether an Unincorporated State is more of a colony or more of a loosely administrated territory depends on the country's policies.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 33 DECENTRALIZED NATIONS</font></p>
<p>​Hello folks, I'm Ofaloaf, one of the content designers on Victoria 3, and I'm here today to talk about <em>decentralized nations</em>. What are they? Why are they there?  </p>
<p>To start with, let's talk about what came before - let's take a quick look at what Victoria (well, <em>Victoria: Revolutions</em>) and <em>Victoria II</em> did when it came to regions outside of traditional imperial homelands.  </p>
<p><em>Africa in Victoria: Revolutions</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image1.png"><img alt="image1.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image1.png" title="image1.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: DFa6D 0 D 0 ' | ' : cPe</font></p>
<p>​Above is Africa as it was represented in <em>Victoria: Revolutions</em>. Most of the continent is open territory for any Great Power to colonize. There's people living there, but they don't do anything. Outside of a few limited cases, like Sokoto, they're represented by… nothing. They do not do anything on their own, and when added to a colonizing power, they just immediately become pawns in the imperial game and don't really care for independence or their own homeland.  </p>
<p><em>Africa in Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image2.jpg"><img alt="image2.jpg" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image2.jpg" title="image2.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>​The same is broadly true in Victoria II. Regions historically colonized by imperial powers, such as most of Africa and parts of the Americas, are represented as unclaimed swathes of land just waiting for an empire to come by and colonize them. The people who live there do not care who marches in, and will just be members of one empire or another forevermore after they are colonized. It's… a model that could use some improvement. It didn't do justice to the people who historically lived there, and, frankly, it made colonial gameplay kind of <em>boring</em>.  </p>
<p><em>Africa as it currently stands in Victoria 3</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image3.jpg"><img alt="image3.jpg" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image3.jpg" title="image3.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>​In Victoria 3, decentralized nations exist to address both the issues of gameplay and better representation of indigenous peoples. No matter where an empire tries to colonize, <em>someone already lives there</em>. They're organized, although they don't have the same level of international recognition and administrative organization as, say, Congress of Vienna attendees.   </p>
<p>No formal declaration of war needs to be made in order to make an incursion into the territories of decentralized nations and start colonizing, although the deeper you colonize into a decentralized nation's lands, the more likely it is a diplomatic play will kick off where the decentralized nation starts a real war of resistance against you. Even if a colony is successfully established, the people living there aren't just pawns - they'll remember that they weren't always colonized subjects, and just like any other part of an empire they'll agitate for independence if conditions are right.  </p>
<p><em>Mapping</em> these nations has been a challenge. We essentially started with the Victoria II map as a base to build off of, which meant we had a lot of work to do just gathering information for peoples across the globe. Records of who lived where, and how many people lived there, have been difficult to obtain for some regions. Gameplay considerations have also driven some design choices - let's look at North America for an example of that process.  </p>
<p><em>Behold the snippet of a beautiful draft image used when presenting the original proposal.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image4.png"><img alt="image4.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image4.png" title="image4.png" /></a></p>

<p>​This is part of one drafted proposal for the implementation of decentralized nations in North America. There's already some compromises in this version - peoples have been consolidated into some larger polities, and some state borders have been followed largely because having just one or two provinces on the other side of a state line can create regions too small to provide anything or anybody - 400 pops living in State X aren't able to provide enough men to contribute a single battalion to a native uprising, among other things. This design isn’t just for the decentralized nations - it is something we also do elsewhere in the world when trying to balance historical accuracy with gameplay, although we of course try to avoid steering too far away from actual history.  </p>
<p><em>North America after the revised proposal was implemented.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image5.jpg"><img alt="image5.jpg" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image5.jpg" title="image5.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Iron Ahsaroka } Pawnee Ute Apache Confederacy 1 Nation Sioux Greal 1 United J Navajo</font></p>
<p>​Even with these considerations, we still ended up pursuing a modified version of that proposal that did more to preserve the borders of larger imperial borders - we didn't want too many avenues for the United States to colonize its way into historical Canadian territories, or for Mexico to colonize its way into Minnesota. I <em>do</em> miss the Council of Three Fires and hope I can get it back in, but that depends on getting a design hammered out that works with the considerations and limitations we just went over above.  </p>
<p>Other regions have had design considerations made in their implementation, too.  </p>
<p><em>(from Wikipedia)</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image6.png"><img alt="image6.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2333%20-%20Decentralized%20Nations/image6.png" title="image6.png" /></a></p>

<p>I'm gonna be real with you, there was no way we were going to accurately and sufficiently map out all the peoples of New Guinea. That's one region where I think we've probably done the most consolidation, but I think it was necessary in order to provide anything like the combined strength needed in order to give the indigenous peoples of New Guinea a decent punch in case of a native uprising.  </p>

<p>West Africa had many design decisions made since it was first mapped out for V3; as mentioned above, the original map built off of was Victoria 2's, so the first thing done was just getting <em>some</em> entity everywhere on the map. This early draft has been revised and revised and revised again, and probably will still be subject to further revisions. Countries that were first marked as decentralized have been centralized, such as the Ashanti Empire, and tag additions and renamings are a thing that's happened already and will happen again, as we continue to invest time in research and listen to feedback from our fans.  </p>
<p>Decentralized nations give life to regions that have been treated as blank slates up 'til now. Mapping them out, getting them right, and balancing the challenges of precision and gameplay are a constant struggle, one which we are constantly tackling and working through. The result of all this, though, is a world that feels much more alive, one that I hope you'll be happily exploring at Victoria 3's release.  </p>
<p>I'm terrible at transitions so let me just say that next week is <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/352223/">@neondt</a>'s dev diary, and we're going to ship some monumental information there! And by that I mean it's on canals and monuments.</p>

<p>Very nice DD and an extremely promising development.  </p>
<p>As always - questions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What about places that genuinly had zero or almost zero population before some developed country claimed them (its mostly small islands in Pacific, but they can be valuable basing points for navies)?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you "absorb" a non-centralized nation without colonizing, through diplomatic plays? For example if US completely surrounds Sioux Nation territory and includes them into their market - will there be an option for a peaceful annexation or maybe protectorate?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise - will decentralized nations be able to start any diplomacy besides anti-colonial uprisings? It would be especially interesting if they could ask for protectorate/colony status from other nations - for example the same Sioux feel threatened by USA, but have better relationship with Canada - could they ask Canada to become their protectorate/colony?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can a developed nation foment uprisings in colonial territories of another nation? Without this the "Great Game" would largely be impossible to simulate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We ended up just associating those islands with the closest nearby inhabited islands, so several Polynesian realms are more widespread than is properly historical.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, the Sioux will not willingly surrender autonomy no matter how many goods the United States send their way.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, part of what makes a decentralized nation functionally different from a centralized one is the lack of an active foreign policy, or much of any organized and directed policies. The Nyamwezi of East Africa do not exchange ambassadors with Oman, and the Pawnee are not centralized enough for any protectorate to stick. If you go through the records of treaties arranged between the US and various native nations, many of them have notes like "Part of the tribe refused to be governed by this act and it had to be repealed later", because there isn't a central authority that can make these things <em>stick</em>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any pops in a country can be agitated through internal mechanics we've discussed in other DDs, like turmoil, standard of living, and the like. Generally speaking, though, we don't intend to have a system at release for directly influencing the pops of other countries, whether they live in a decentralized nation or a centralized state.  </p>
</li>

There could be arguments either way, but I do think they ought to be represented in some way at least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Seminole is something I've personally angsted over and flip-flopped on repeatedly. At the moment, the Seminole are <em>not</em> in as a decentralized nation, but if a good design gets hashed out I hope we'll have a chance to implement the Seminole on the map prior to release.  </p>

<p>Do decentralized nations ever become centralized if left alone or if they successfully drive off colonial powers? If they win against a colonizer do they just fall back into their decentralized ignorance or do they try to actively prepare for the next potential colonizer in some way, even if not through centralizing?   </p>
<p>This might be a bit too much of a lift for it to be included at release but I’d love to eventually see something along these lines.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The iwi have been consolidated largely into the Ngai Tahu and Ngati Toa, those two being the two most prominent iwi at the end of the Musket Wars as I understand it. North Island, moreover, also has the United Tribes and some colonization by New South Wales- an image was shared on Twitter earlier this week of the setup, and I noticed a lot of people assumed the NSW bit was directly British-controlled because it's a British puppet and takes on its color because of that.</p>

<p>No, there's no way for a centralized nation to become decentralized.  </p>

<p>This has been my biggest complaint about the EUIV colonial system, so good job fixing this before it became an issue. How exactly do the mechanics of colonizing work though? That wasn't explained well in the previous Dev Diary, and we learn now that there will be no regions of the world that start uncontrolled. If I am playing as the US, do I just select a state region that still has decentralized nations in control of part of it, then push a button to start the colony? Is a colony ever considered "finished" and stop taking up part of the colonial resources, or do all unincorporated states take up a permanent part of your colonial pool, unless they become incorporated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonization is done on a state-by-state basis. It's started with a fairly straightforward process like you describe, but as colonization progresses, so does tension, so the more of a state region is colonized, the more likely it is that it'll blow up and decentralized nations will fight directly against the colonizer. Depending on the circumstances, this is either a speedbump or a serious challenge. If a country's at peace and doing just fine, a war against a single decentralized nation is no major hurdle, but I've seen games where the US continued to intrude into Native American territory even while at war with the British, resulting in a Sioux uprising <em>succeeding</em>, regaining the lands lost to the US in earlier colonization.  </p>
<p>There's no real "colonial" pool- unincorporated provinces just eat up more bureaucracy, from the same bureaucratic pool that other things draw from for their own maintenance.  </p>

<p>The Ottomans aren't decentralized, even if they fail the Sick Man of Europe content we've written. They're more liable to be subject to very direct forms of imperialism, but not colonization in the same way decentralized nations experience it.  </p>

<p>They're still pops, and pops do pop things like revolt. On a pop-by-pop basis, there is no mechanical difference between a pop that is culturally Comanche and a pop that is culturally Polish. In the same way that a Polish pop, if it is sufficiently angry and part of a non-Polish realm, may support a Polish nationalist uprising, a Comanche pop might also revolt if it's sufficiently angry.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 34 CANALS ( MONUMENTS</font></p>
<p>​Good evening and welcome to this week’s Victoria 3 development diary! Today’s topic is Canals &amp; Monuments, unique buildings with special inputs, outputs, and effects.  </p>
<p><em>The Vatican City is the seat of the Catholic Church and a great asset to the Papal States in Victoria 3. As Europe developed and industrialized, the power of religious authority in national politics declined steeply but never lost its relevance. Can you change the course of history and renew the temporal power of the Pope?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2334%20-%20Canals%20%26%20Monuments/DD34%2001.png"><img alt="DD34 01.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2334%20-%20Canals%20%26%20Monuments/DD34%2001.png" title="DD34 01.png" /></a></p>

<p>​Monuments are unique buildings only available in specific states, each with its own 3D model on the map. They make use of some of the more interesting aspects of the production methods system; just as buildings can output Goods, they can also output both national and local modifiers, <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-2-capacities.1477662/">Capacities</a>, and effects on the pops working there. The Vatican City for instance outputs the Influence capacity as well as greatly increasing the political strength of the Devout <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Interest Group</a>. Meanwhile the White House adds a multiplier to your national Bureaucracy output as well as increasing the amount of political strength Pops gain from votes. Not all Monuments are present at the start date. Some, like the Eiffel Tower, must be constructed, and Monuments are significantly more costly and time-consuming to construct than standard buildings. Monuments are subsidized by government funding, so if you decide that a Monument is unaffordable or that you aren’t interested in its effects (for instance if you as communist Italy no longer want to Church to wield so much power) you can simply defund them. On release we intend to have eleven different Monuments in total.  </p>
<p><em>The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Finally completed in 1914 after decades of planning and construction, ships no longer had to take the long and treacherous route around South America to travel between the East and West. Yes, we can see the trees and houses in the Canal - we’ll fix it!</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Colon Panama City</font></p>
<p>​Like Monuments, Canals are unique buildings with a special set of inputs and outputs. But the true allure of constructing a Canal is that it allows you to create new connections between sea nodes, allowing ships to travel through the isthmuses of Panama and Suez. This significantly reduces the Convoy costs for trading and supplying armies across vast ocean distances, as well as your vulnerability to unscrupulous rivals trying to disrupt your supply lines.  </p>
<p><em>We use the Journal Entry system to track the progress of your canal survey. Behind the scenes a variable is increased every month until the goal is reached, which triggers the completion event. The Journal Entry also acts as a reminder that you are spending a lot of Bureaucracy on this project, and that it will eventually be made available again once the survey is complete.</em>  </p>

<p>​Constructing a Canal is far from trivial. Before any work can begin, an extensive survey of the region needs to be conducted, costing a hefty chunk of Bureaucracy for the surveyor for around 3 years. Either the owner of the state or a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-18-rank-prestige.1493822/">Great Power</a> with an Interest in the region can conduct a survey. Any number of countries can potentially conduct their own surveys and compete to build the Canal themselves.  </p>
<p><em>We’ve made the conscious decision to avoid starting wars or Diplomatic Plays through scripted content wherever possible, instead offering incentives for the player to start their own Plays and encouraging the AI to pursue Journal Entry goals. In this case, the player has the option to either gain a Claim on Sinai or to improve relations with the owner country, helping you along your chosen path but not locking you into a particular course of action.</em>  </p>

<p>​Once you’ve completed your survey, the path diverges depending on whether you own the appropriate land. If you already own either a Treaty Port or the whole state region you can simply begin constructing the canal, but if not you’ll need to find a way to acquire it, either through monetary or coercive means. A Decision becomes available allowing you to purchase a Treaty Port in the appropriate <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-16-states.1491897/">State Region</a> in exchange for a series of very large weekly payments, assuming you can convince the local rulers to part with the port. You might however decide that you’d rather keep your money and start a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-21-diplomatic-plays.1495892/">Diplomatic Play</a> for a Treaty Port or the entire State Region (the former will cost you a lot less Infamy), which might lead either to a peaceful concession to your demands or to war.  </p>
<p>And that’s all for today! Next week I’ll be handing you over to one of our Content Designers to talk about Expeditions and Decisions.</p>

<p>The problem is with the national-scale effects, which don't seem to have any connection to the pops working at the building as far as I can tell. There doesn't seem to be any reason why owning and maintaining the building would cause the effect that it has. Why would the Ottoman Empire conquering Rome make the government more inclined to listen to the Devout IG? Why would the White House burning down make the entire federal bureaucracy permanently become significantly less efficient, or change how political power is distributed in the country? That's the sort of thing I was referring to as "magical effects". Victoria 3 is supposed to be about simulating society, and these sort of causeless changes strike me as being incompatible with that goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great point! You're right that some of the current <em>effects</em> of monument-type buildings are perhaps unsuitable for the game's theme. As usual the exact numbers are WIP and we definitely appreciate the feedback. I hear you on the White House's national Bureaucracy multiplier for example - will rework this into a larger bonus to <em>local</em> Government Administration buildings instead.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, some monument buildings <em>ought</em> to have national effects, as symbols of the nation's accomplishments or identity - the Eiffel Tower or the Hagia Sophia are good examples of these. And if the Ottoman Empire conquers Rome and don't want their Devout IG to gain additional political strength from having taken control of the Vatican, they (or anyone who controls it) <em>can</em> certainly burn it to the ground. It is just a building, and follow all the normal building rules. Monuments don't have any special powers to affect the country in non-immersive, "magical" seeming ways - if they do, we may have made a mistake, and mistakes can be easily fixed. Smile    :)</p>

<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/669315/">@lachek</a> I see you went with the same system as EU4 where monuments are all historic and predefined to their specific nations and places.  </p>
<p>So, generic monuments anyone can build are out of question, outside of mods? Couldn't there be at least five or so so that any nation could havr a shot at having their own?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a many reasons for this:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Monuments are <em>positioned manually on the map</em> to ensure they fit into the landscape and city hubs. It would be virtually impossible to ensure the Statue of Liberty seamlessly meshes with every coastline unless we painstakingly went through every single coastal state and experimented with its placement there. This means doing this for all states (currently over 700) for all monuments in the game (currently 11) to ensure we place every single monument in the game in a unique position.</li>
<li>Many of these monuments are <em>already in place</em> at the start of the game. Nevertheless, if we did have a system where you could build the Eiffel Tower anywhere, then we ought to also have a system where you could build Vatican City somewhere else if you razed it. This means that for consistency we ought to be manually positioning the Vatican City in every single state even though it's unlikely to ever be built elsewhere.</li>
<li>Should countries be allowed to build duplicates? After all, if the White House gives such a sweet bonus then shouldn't France or China be able to build the White House too? At that point these buildings become not really special in any way - the White House becomes just a "Bureaucracy Multiplier Palace", the Eiffel Tower just a "Prestige Tower", etc.</li>
<li>Some of these monuments are ancient, like Angkor Wat, and are special for this very reason. While you might be able to destroy these in-game, the idea of rebuilding them just doesn't make sense. The idea of <em>another</em> country rebuilding them in <em>another place</em> doubly doesn't make sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>As should be clear from the above, making monuments generic and buildable by anyone would not only take inordinate time and effort for the development team compared to what it adds to the game, but also cause them to lose a lot of their unique appeal and introduces many strange exception cases that also has to be dealt with. This means we were left with two options: historical monuments in predefined places, or no monuments in any places. We felt it would be a missed opportunity to not acknowledge the enormous feats of engineering countries often engaged in for prestige during this era, so we went with door number one.</p>

<p>Monuments feel like the "great people" of buildings and I thought that we were trying to stay away from a great-people history simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I see it, the trick with both monuments and characters is to sprinkle them into the gameplay for flavor and historical immersion, without making them so central and important mechanically that they start to dominate. Because yes you're right, we want to tell the story of the many social and economic forces that shaped our modern world, not about how some particular genius statesman or destined nation made the world their oyster. But it'd be a poor decision, I think, to leave them out of the game altogether!</p>

<p>Regarding Vatican City and how it grants additional power to the clergy regardless of state religion, it's mainly a result of the fact that we can't trigger a Production Method on religion - it's not a Law, or a Tech, or another Production Method. If time permits we might add that functionality, which would then easily let us change the behavior of Vatican City depending on the state religion of the controlling country.</p>

<p>It's functionality we do want to add, but haven't yet, so it's not something I can promise at release. There's a small bundle of potential mechanics oriented around control of narrow naval passages I'd like to explore, so I don't want to prioritize shoehorning in special mechanics only for canals that will rarely have an impact if we can create something more coherent and universally applicable instead.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 35 EXPEDITIONS ( DECISIONS</font></p>
<p>​Good evening and welcome back to another Victoria 3 development diary! This time written by our Content Designer Veronica. Today we will talk about two topics that are intrinsically connected: Expeditions and Decisions.  </p>
<p>The Victorian age was also the age of exploration. Campaigns were sent to explore the farther territories of the world and discover their hidden mysteries. Scholars turned their attention to uncharted territories and promises of glory and fortune; numerous papers and conferences were produced on behalf of science and this era set the foundations for modern studies.  </p>
<p>But these expeditions were not without peril - many failed, and not all of them returned. This, we also wanted to represent.  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3, you will be able to take a Decision to go on an Expedition if you fulfill the requisites for it: namely having an interest in the region and, sometimes, a special technology. For instance, exploring the African rivers without protection against malaria may not be the greatest idea. Apart from that, any country can decide to embark on this adventurous enterprise.  </p>
<p><em>Dr. Livingstone, I presume?</em>  </p>

<p>​But what is a <em>Decision</em>? A Decision is a specific option that you can take when you meet the requirements, thus triggering an important or special event. They don't require any completion conditions because you'll only be able to take them when you already meet those. Some Decisions will allow you to go on an Expedition, like in this case, but many others trigger historical events, like the Grand Exhibition or the Decision to build the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-34-canals-monuments.1511589/">Canals</a> that we saw last week.  </p>
<p>Some, but not all, Decisions will also add a Journal Entry so you can track how the event is going, like the surveillance of the canals. Others just fire an immediate event because it's not an ongoing circumstance, so you get to see the immediate results.  </p>
<p><em>The decision to trigger the Grand Exhibition will give you a Journal Entry and a countdown to make it as great as you can. You can do so by special exhibition events, going on expeditions to retrieve important artifacts or by researching new technologies that you can showcase to the world. Of course, we also take into consideration everything you've achieved up to that point, so you can still trigger the exhibition after having completed all expeditions and your findings will be taken into account and displayed.</em>  </p>

<p>​Once you take an Expedition Decision, a starting event will trigger setting up the preparations for the journey. If you decide to go on with it, you'll be asked to choose a leader and a budget, then a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-31-journal-entries.1508059/">Journal Entry</a> will be added to your game with a progress bar that indicates, well, the progress of the expedition. Also, bear in mind that the leader's skills and traits may also play a part in the success of the group and how they face the events they encounter. A drunkard leader may delay your expedition while entering a nervous breakdown because they miss their addiction - or they could even lose their vice.  </p>
<p><em>The expedition Journal Entry will keep track of your advances with a progress bar, and will trigger different ending events depending on your results. A high progress means a successful expedition, while getting a high peril before reaching the end means a more grim completion event, regardless of your progress.</em>  </p>

<p>​Expeditions use two main variables: progress and peril. When you reach a high enough progress the expedition will complete successfully; however, a high peril will mean that the expedition may be lost or even die. You'll be able to control how these variables progress through your decisions during the expedition events: every month you'll receive an update on how your expedition is doing where you'll act as their leader and choose how they should proceed. Sometimes, however, the expedition will go on peacefully and you'll receive a progress event instead that increases both your progress and peril by one point. You'll also get an updated map location on where your expedition is at the moment, so you can see them advance (or not).  </p>

<p>Expeditions are extremely moddable. The progress and peril mechanics are, behind the scenes, just ordinary variables which shows you just how much can be done with the fundamental tools of the scripting languagee.  </p>
<p>You can absolutely use decisions to trigger events. We use decisions to trigger events, add journal entries, set variables, apply modifiers, and just about anything else you could think to do with our scripting language. The Alaska Purchase decision, for instance, immediately fires an event.  </p>

<p>No terra incognita. The shape of the world and its political players are largely a known quantity by 1836. We didn't feel it would be an especially relevant mechanic for Victoria 3.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 36 CONSTRUCTION</font></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to another Victoria 3 development diary! Today we’ll be returning to more mechanics-oriented dev diaries, starting out with a very important mechanic for the economic development of your 19th century nation - the construction of new <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-3-buildings.1478868/">Buildings</a>.  </p>
<p>Construction in Strategy games tends to follow a pretty typical formula: you save up money, order a construction and pay a lump-sum cost, wait some time, and the new building pops into existence. As mentioned in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-12-treasury.1488588/">Dev Diary 12</a>, however, the vast majority of expenses in Victoria 3 are not lump-sum costs but applied over time as part of your national budget. So how does it work instead? To answer that, there’s a few concepts we need to cover, namely <strong>Construction Capacity,</strong> the <strong>Construction Sector</strong> and the <strong>Construction Queue.</strong>   </p>
<p>Let’s start then with Construction Capacity - which is actually just named Construction in-game, but we’re calling it Construction Capacity here to differentiate it from the overall concept of building things. This is a country-wide value of your nation’s overall ability to make progress on new buildings in a single week. For example, if your country produces a total of 100 Construction and a new Textile Mill costs 300 Construction, you’d expect to be able to build that Textile Mill in a total of 3 weeks. However, it’s a little more complicated than that, as we’ll see below when we explain the Construction Queue.  </p>
<p><em>With Construction Sectors present in Lower Egypt, Matruh, Sinah and Palestine, the Egypt in this screenshot generates a respectable amount of Construction for the early game, though their finances may struggle a bit to fund it all.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2336%20%E2%80%93%20Construction/DD36%2001.png"><img alt="DD36 01.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2336%20%E2%80%93%20Construction/DD36%2001.png" title="DD36 01.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP 45.8 Construction Total: 45.80 +10.00 from Base Value Construction 45145 Lower Egypt: +15.60 from Construction Sector in Lower Egypt Logging Camps Matruh: +5.00 from Construction Sector in Matruh Sinai: Logging Camps +10.20 Construction Sector in Sinai Palestine: +5.00 from Construction Sector in Palestine Logging Camps Logging Camps Queued 2.9% Total time left: 16 weeks from</font></p>
<p>So, how do you produce Construction? This is where the Construction Sector comes in. All countries get a tiny amount of ‘free’ Construction Capacity to ensure that you never get stuck in a situation where you need Construction Capacity to expand your Construction Sector but need a Construction Sector to get Construction Capacity. This amount is woefully small though, and wholly insufficient even for a small nation, so if you’re not planning to run a subsistence economy long-term you will definitely need to invest in a proper Construction Sector by building more Construction Sector buildings in your states.  </p>
<p>Mechanically speaking, the Construction Sector is a type of government building which employs people and uses goods to output Construction Capacity with a variety of different Production Methods, ranging from simple Wooden Buildings to modern arc-welded Steel and Glass structures. It does work a little bit differently though, in that the amount of Goods used by the Construction Sector each week depends on the actual need for Construction Capacity - if your Country is producing a total of 500 Construction Capacity, but will only need 250 for ongoing projects that week, the total usage of Goods in the Construction Sector is cut by half - though you still have to pay the wages of all the Pops employed there.  </p>
<p><em>More advanced methods of construction are expensive and require complex goods - but you will find it difficult to build up a true industrialized economy without them.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2336%20%E2%80%93%20Construction/DD36%2002.png"><img alt="DD36 02.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2336%20%E2%80%93%20Construction/DD36%2002.png" title="DD36 02.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP CONSTRUCTION &lt;SECTOR Istanhul Building in Lower Egypt Information Workforce Modifiers Employment: 15.0K Government Expenses: 0 -0.94K Mobilized Battalions: 0 / 0 (0.00%) 3 Production Methods Base Change Base Production Method to Wooden Buildings Wooden Buildings X This Production Method is already active Process Unscaled Modifiers: +10.0% State Construction Efficiency Iron-Frame Buildings Total Modifiers: +15.0 Construction Steel-Frame Buildings Goods Consumption: Fabric: +150 Total {18.9 Wood: +150 Total ( € 26.1 Arc-Welded Buildings Increased Employment: Slave Upk Laborers or Slaves: +14.2K Total 415 Urbanization Bureaucrats: +750 Total +3 Infrastructure Show per Level values Goods Input: -100% Throughput: +4% airo Construction 0/25 Idle Pause Nothing is Under Construction Wages Usage</font></p>
<p>Ultimately, what this means is that how fast you can build things depends entirely on how much money, goods and research you’re willing to throw into your Construction Sector - having only a handful of Construction Sector buildings using only Wood and Fabric will certainly be cheaper and easier than building up a sprawling Construction Sector using Steel-Frame Buildings, but will naturally limit your ability to industrialize your nation.  </p>
<p>So then, how does Construction Capacity actually turn into finished buildings? This is where the Construction Queue comes in. Each country has a nation-wide Construction Queue, with each project in the Queue corresponding to building a single level of a Building in a specific State. For example, a Construction Queue in Sweden might look like this (all numbers are examples):  </p>
<ol>
<li>Expand Government Administration in Svealand (250/300 Construction Capacity remaining)</li>
<li>Expand Fishing Wharves in Norrland (155/180 Construction Capacity remaining)</li>
<li>Expand Fishing Wharves in Norrland (180/180 Construction Capacity remaining)</li>
<li>Expand Rye Farms in Svealand (180/180 Construction Capacity remaining)</li>
<li>Expand Port in Götaland (240/240 Construction Capacity remaining)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each week, your produced Construction Capacity is allocated to projects in the Queue in order of priority, with a maximum speed at which projects can proceed (so it’s never possible to, say, build the Panama Canal in a single week). Using the above construction queue as an example, let’s say the maximum progress that can be made each week is 50, and Sweden is producing 112 Construction Capacity.  </p>
<p>This would mean that projects 1 and 2 would both be allocated 50 Construction Capacity, while project 3 would get the left-over 12 and projects 4 and 5 would not progress at all in that week. It would take 5 weeks for entry 1 to finish at that pace, but after only 3 weeks, project 2 will be down to only 5 progress needed, and so most of the Construction Capacity allocated to it will be freed up for other projects. This also means that project 2 will actually finish before project 1, which is perfectly normal, as different buildings require different amounts of Construction Capacity to complete - it’s easier to build a Rye Farm than a Shipyard.  </p>
<p><em>With just above 40 construction output and the help of some local Construction Efficiency bonuses, this country is able to make rapid progress on the Wheat Farms and Iron Mines at the top of the queue and even get a bit of weekly extra progress on the Logging Camps.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2336%20%E2%80%93%20Construction/DD36%2003.png"><img alt="DD36 03.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2336%20%E2%80%93%20Construction/DD36%2003.png" title="DD36 03.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP BUILDINGS Urban Rural Development Construction 40.599 Construction 40/40 Pause Wheat Farms 20 90.0% Iron Mines 20 52.8% Logging 0% Logging Camps Queued 0% Total time left: 17 weeks Camps</font></p>
<p>If all this seems confusing, don’t worry! All you really need to understand is that the more Construction Capacity you have, the faster things go - but a large Construction Sector will need to be kept busy with multiple projects at once if you want to use its entire output.  </p>
<p>There is one more important factor to Construction, which is a modifier called State Construction Efficiency that governs how effective each point of Construction Capacity you put into building Buildings in a State is. For example, a state with a +50% bonus to State Construction Efficiency means that every Construction Capacity allocated to projects in that State actually results in 1.5 progress on said projects, while a malus of -50% would reduce it to 0.5 actual progress.  </p>
<p>A few factors that will increase or decrease State Construction Efficiency are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Terrain-based State Traits, such as mountains or jungle, tends to reduce State Construction Efficiency</li>
<li>Building a Construction Sector in a State increases the local State Construction Efficiency</li>
<li>Low Market Access reduces State Construction Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Industrializing the Amazon Rainforest is neither easy nor cheap.</em>  </p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28126451">lachek reqplied to Dev Diary #36 – Construction</a></h4>
<p>Finding a way to make the construction industry private <em>is</em> an aspiration we have, actually! Like many of you have pointed out, it does sound really cool and more realistic.  </p>
<p>As it turns out though, after quite a bit of experimentation, this is harder than you might expect at first blush. For example, would you really want a gameplay dynamic where the fewer buildings you construct at once, the cheaper it is to construct those buildings, making it optimal (but very inconvenient) to only construct one thing at a time? What about if you do build a large number of buildings at once, creating a need for a large number of construction workers, who then get fired as soon as the construction completes because there's no projects left to work on? If construction industry is all very local in nature, how do you build ports to connect your overseas markets when local access to construction materials is non-existent? Do you have to set (and potentially constantly adjust) a construction budget that determines how much resources the construction industry has to operate with?  </p>
<p>All these quite tricky questions, each of which add a number of gameplay concerns that need solutions, fade away when you treat Construction not as a variable-cost good bought and sold on the open market but as a capacity, with the player's job being to appropriately size that capacity while minimizing its cost. While I'd love to continue experimenting with Construction Sectors in the future to see if we can find a model where they can operate privately without damaging gameplay, I find it provides just the right level of player decision-making at the moment, while still being quite a bit more involved and interconnected with our socioeconomic simulation than construction usually is in strategy games.</p>

<p>The investment pool can be used to cover the costs of all allowed constructions, so how much you can draw from it each week depends on where your construction allocation is going, ie whether you are currently building things that can be funded by it.</p>

<p>On the topic of always paying wages, we used to have the construction sector fire its employees when not building things but this created a variety of weird gameplay flows and honestly just didn’t feel very good.

<p>​Hi I’m Paul “PDJR_Alastorn” Depre - member of the QA team on Victoria 3. I’ve been asked to write about market expansion in Victoria 3 and how that can be done through the mechanics of a customs union. Apparently my credentials speak for themselves:  </p>
<p><em>Have you ever had that day where multiple coworkers message you simultaneously to let you know you’ve become a meme by way of the Victoria 3 fanbase?</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/ProudBavaria/status/1457711567013879811"><em>[Twitter Link to greater Meme]</em></a>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Paul know money good</font></p>
<p>​So as you have no doubt seen in screenshots, dev diaries, after action reports, and the like, in Victoria 3 we have introduced the concept of a customs union but we’ve yet to truly go into detail about what they actually entail as a means of market expansion. <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-9-national-markets.1484917/">[See Previous Dev Diaries]</a>. That’s why I am here today, in no small part because I find the customs union one of the more interesting mechanics of Victoria 3 compared to its previous iterations such as Spheres of Influence, which after saying that I hope it doesn’t set your expectations too high but I guess it's on me to try and explain why I feel that way. Alright, no pressure then.  </p>
<p>So, what exactly is a customs union and how does it relate to market expansion? Before I explain it mechanically, I would like to define the concept both conceptually and historically so we are all starting with a similar frame of reference. Promise me you will continue reading till the mechanical explanation before you make assumptions based on obscure historical examples? Good, then let's go forth.  </p>
<p>A customs union, and I am literally pulling the definition from Wikipedia here folks, is generally understood to be a trade bloc or arrangement among nations. It is most commonly known as a free trade area with a common external tariff, or common external tariff policy. The bonds of a custom union are at the very least economical, they exist for the purposes of increasing trade, economic co-dependence, and mutual benefit that comes from such and can lead to closer political and cultural ties between countries. They do not necessitate a political union though they are certainly seen through history as the stepping stones towards such.  </p>
<p>One of the more well known, at least to the Vicky fanbase, is the Zollverein which helped further facilitate the unification of Germany but by no means was the sole deciding factor of that movement. The European Union, it can be argued, started off as merely the European Coal and Steel Community, which was a more restricted definition of a customs union but certainly counts in my eyes. Whether or not the North American Free Trade Agreement counts as a customs union is up for debate. While trade agreements regularly cover similar topics of tariff and economic co-dependence they are usually of a smaller scope and scale. Ultimately the economics of it is tricky, because it involves politics and what defines a union vs an agreement is not always a coherent 1:1 and before I get into explaining all the counterarguments of historical note, let's actually talk about the game some now, shall we?  </p>
<p><em>The Zollverein represented at game start.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2337%20%E2%80%93%20Market%20Expansion/DD37%2001.png"><img alt="DD37 01.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2337%20%E2%80%93%20Market%20Expansion/DD37%2001.png" title="DD37 01.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: 7o_ Austrian Markel Market WIP Faltic oa Market #ssian (Juteh Svish /</font></p>
<p>​Within the scope of Victoria 3, a custom’s union is a bilateral agreement between two nations where one nation agrees to subject its national market to another and to be absorbed into an economic union. This means that it’s a diplomatic action, a.k.a. something another nation has to agree to as a customs union alone is not something that is normally able to be forced upon another nation. A customs union is not limited to only two partners, other nations may make themselves subject to the senior partner alongside other participant junior nations but a customs union can have only one senior member in control of the union.  </p>

<p>​Slight variance to the above statement is possible, custom unions can be forced through by utilizing obligations by the previously owed country. This will only allow the diplomatic action to take place despite the nation’s disposition to say no, it should not be able to supersede any other limitations possible in the game. Thus it's entirely possible as a larger power to go, “you want me to pay off your debt? Sure, I’ll do it for a favor” and then force the unsuspecting debtor country into its market. Always be aware of the small text written into your diplomatic dealings!  </p>
<p>Customs unions themselves cannot be forced through war but they can be forced as a result of other diplomatic entanglements. Certain subject relationships come with the implicit expectations of joining the shared market of their overlord but they also come with other strings attached. <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-20-diplomatic-actions.1495234/">[See Subjects Dev Diary]</a>  </p>
<p>What allows a customs union to exist? That is dependent upon the trade policy of the participant nations, not all domestic laws allow for a nation to partake in a customs union (though most will alongside various other trade changes). Trade will be coming with a future dev diary so I will not be going into detail about that here, apologies.  </p>
<p>But assuming that two nations both have trade policies that would allow them to do so, that’s all that’s needed to form a custom’s union? Well… no, economic unions of such are not simple agreements to be engaged in and reneged upon on a whim with anyone in particular. They have some more base level requirements.  </p>
<p>The two nations (or more specifically the junior partner in question and the senior partner overseeing the market) must have neutral or positive relations to conduct this action. A nation who sees you in an antagonistic light as you are attempting to wipe them off the map isn’t going to give you access to its market willingly. Two nations that are trying to wipe each other off the map can both be junior partners in the same customs union led by another nation, just expect all the market disruption that would come with such chaotic developments if it's your frustration to handle as the overseeing power.  </p>
<p>A senior member of a customs union must not be a subject of the junior partner or be a junior partner in another customs union. I'm not sure how the more lowly powers might feel about the matter, but the national prestige of this great power will not be subject to any Bavarian market. They must bow to Lubeck or there is no deal! AI considerations such as the requirements of port connection to facilitate market access, comparative GDP, rank, infamy and other diplomatic considerations are taken into account when accepting or proposing this relationship.  </p>
<p><em>You are given the breakdown as to why the AI may not be so willing to join your Customs Union. And you can seek to overcome these differences peacefully.</em>  </p>

<p>​As well, this relationship is not a one and done, it must be maintained and this is seen both in an influence upkeep by the senior partner per junior member (as they hold the prestige of it being their market and policies which take priority) but a relations upkeep by all partners and the senior member lest they be booted from the union.  </p>

<p>​In the end what does “subjecting themselves to the senior partners market” mean? For all intents and purposes it means that the national market of the junior partner no longer exists - they are part of the senior partners market, so all goods produced, bought and sold are done so within the confines of that new national market. This can mean many things and depending on the relative disparities of your previously independent markets, prices can shift towards a new equilibrium as supply and demand internally change to reflect this. Businesses will revisit their input costs and subsequently adjust their labor cost if necessary. You may see some industries boom and others start running on their reserves, hoping for trends to change before they shut their doors entirely, unable to compete with those industrialists in the far-off city.  </p>
<p>Any trade routes you might have had as a junior partner may be disrupted, you are not barred from trading outright as a junior member of the union but since it's no longer your national market you will have to engage in a few extra steps to take part in such. This is something we will go into more detail within a future dev diary so it will be simple statements at the moment, apologies again.  </p>
<p>For internal trade, market access will now be calculated based on infrastructure usage in the recipient state and whether it has a connection to the market capital of the senior member. If you cannot connect the routes by land then ports will need to be staffed and supplied to provide such connections. If you are the senior partner and you’ve found with the addition of new members they are struggling to connect to your market capital, you can always consider shifting the center of your market elsewhere to better accommodate all members.  </p>

<p>​Domestically you will still be able to tax and encourage specific goods and services and their consumption, but your ability to embargo or take tariffs on goods coming into the market will depend on your relationship within the customs union… but I am getting ahead of myself - more on that in a future development diary so please be patient on that front.  </p>
<p>So what are the benefits of expanding your market by customs union? Why not just gobble up the territory by forcing someone to be your vassal or taking them under your direct authority?  </p>
<p>If you were to take the territory, well you might have to do so militarily if the nation is unwilling to come along willingly. If that is the case then it's going to be a national expenditure to mobilize and supply your armed forces, you’re certainly going to take some infamy on the world stage, you might even lose the conflict depending on who gets involved. What if you need to concede part of the market to another nation to assist you - what if it's the resources you really wanted yourself. Even in the winning scenario you end up with a bunch of pops in a devastated landscape, radicalizing and potentially discriminated against in your larger empire - all you wanted was some coal, was that cost worth it?

<p>​The benefits of the customs union are many but they can also be a double edged sword - it's not guaranteed to be beneficial and it's much more in the lines of choosing which problems you wish to face as is much of the way with Victoria 3.  </p>
<p>A benefit of a customs union is that it decreases “relative transportation costs” compared to sticking to trading more manually among markets. You may not need to keep trade routes active though you may still need to utilize convoys for market connections. Instead of moving a more limited amount of goods between two markets you have the sum total of to markets buy orders and sell orders interacting. This may be very welcoming to some as it means less intensive micromanagement of their national economy and allows them to more natural growth of their industries. This also means the potential degradation if not dismissal of your transportation industry that fuels the trade sector of your economy, which also has implications. Which one is more beneficial to you ultimately depends on what you are trying to do, the size of your nation, and what you can afford.  </p>
<p>A customs union means both increased goods accessibility and sales accessibility - for example you can trade with Prussia for your much needed coal as Lubeck (as you’ve seen me do in previous AARs) but trade is fickle, subject to changing winds of national priority, diplomatic scuffles, and possibly embargoes. Embedding yourself into the national economy of another gives you more concrete access to those goods and sales potential, but it also means they have access to your national economy with relatively less barriers. In the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/sigart/lubeck_aar_part_1_political_parties_confirmed/">Lubeck AAR</a> we turned the competitive advantage of our national industry focused on tools and shipping to further turn a profit in the larger Prussian market at the cost of less productive industries. Because we were able to keep the standard of living high and a Prussia devastated by revolt did not look as appealing (as it's never one single factor that determines these things) we profited further both monetarily and through migration.  </p>
<p><em>Shipyard profits which were flagging within Lubeck see growth (and hopefully future profit) when being sold on the greater Prussian Market.</em>  </p>

<p>​As Greece (the most recent <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/t1auv3/greece_aar_part_1/">AAR</a>) we joined the British Market with neither a stable standard of living nor a competitive advantage in any particular industry to carve our niche, thus our prices fell drastically and wages inflated as pops moved elsewhere to greener lands in the far British Empire. Could we have been successful as Greece? Certainly, the problems there are not guaranteed but we clearly moved into that market too soon with no clear plan to take advantage of it and thus we were the one’s being taken advantage of.  </p>
<p><em>Greece, after joining the British Market sees its pops migrate to sunnier shores, well at least more economically thriving shores.</em>  </p>

<p>​The price and standard of living differences across customs unions can have an effect on your (and other partners) populations and whether or not they choose to migrate. There is a clear advantage here if you are a relatively prosperous nation either with a good standard of living or just the law of large numbers on your side that you will see a population growth due expanding a market with a customs union. More pops is usually good, but let me make the argument that in some cases having migration away from your country can also be good in the case of a customs union.  </p>
<p>Let's say you are a multiethnic empire, and some of your pops are a little uppity with the ideas of nationalism and their own independence, thoughts that don’t really sit well with your own as they jeopardize the stability of the empire as a whole. You can discriminate, repress, put in police and security forces to try and keep things under control - but that’s expensive. It's even harder to maintain when there is the homeland state these pops yearn to join on their border. What… What if you brought that neighboring country (through agreement or force) into your custom’s union? Sure your hinterlands may have a population migration to their homeland but you no longer have an insurrectionary problem to deal with. As opposed to them just mass migrating away to another country and/or market, you can have them stay within your economic borders if not exactly your national borders, thus keeping all the production and consumption benefits of the pops with relatively less insurrectionary costs.  </p>
<p>Now that is a very cherry-picked example, but ultimately not all migration seen through a customs union is bad - even as a small nation willingly allowing migration of your poorer population within can allow you to refocus your economy (economic policies willing) and potentially attract them back post reform. A custom union allows such plays to be one’s where you don’t have an immediate zero-sum loss and can pull such pops or new ones back to your nation.  </p>
<p>And before I digress into every other mechanics I would like to cover the most important “why would I allow myself to be subjected as a minor nation within a customs union, when it's clearly not advantageous to me” scenario. Well it certainly beats the alternative of getting wiped off the map or subjected further doesn’t it? Thinking in a realpolitik sense, if you are a small or middling state and you don't want to have your domestic resources gobbled up by a larger power, but you don’t have a way to protect yourself without submitting to another power, the only way to succeed is to submit partially. Now you could take the diplomatic route and step under the larger power as a suzerain in some way, some of these may necessitate a customs union regardless. They also can necessitate a loss of your diplomatic potential as an independent entity, that might not be a prefered option on your end. Submitting to a customs union willingly might not be the most advantageous of your choices, but tying your economy to theirs might be a way to maintain some distance from an inevitable political union. Potentially you could turn this to your advantage and maintain a separate diplomatic policy because of such integration. In the AAR as Lubeck we submitted to the Prussian customs union because it was a way to guarantee the AI would not easily turn towards us as a means of expansion and hopefully if we tied our economies close enough together they would not seek to interfere in our affairs, lest we bring the institutions to a halt.  </p>
<p>And in closing, that’s a smattering of the potential that market expansion through a customs union can have. I could probably no doubt talk on this point further, until release potentially but I sadly have some forum limit or another about how long this post can be. I look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on this topic in the various channels. Even more, I look forward to seeing how you all take this feature and play with it in the future when the game releases.  </p>
<p>And with that I would like to take a moment to address the ~~elephant~~ economics degree in the room. Never did I think that uttering those words before my introduction would come to be the meme it is today, but regardless of that, I would like to all correct you that the phrase “did you know Paul Depre the QA Lead on Victoria 3 has a degree in economics?” is no longer technically correct and has not been for some time as I have taken over the role of QA Manager on PDS Red. I am still heavily involved with Victoria 3, assisting in the onboarding of the new QA lead, giving input and the such. Just now I am making sure that not only does the game have a good level of quality, but that the QA team has what it needs to ensure that for release and onwards.  </p>
<p><em>The team “celebrated” this news in the best way they knew how - the loading text was updated almost immediately to be “more correct” so I could not ask for it to be removed as a bug.</em>  </p>

<p>Great dev diary Paul, I love your writing style. Quick question for you. Custom unions seem great if your primary interest in another country is resources, but I am wondering if there’s a way to help a country along in resource production? Say we’re the US and we just added Brazil into our customs union since they have a lot of tasty resources like rubber and tropical wood. The only problem is our industry quickly gobbles up their supply of resources. Is there a way we can help them along, either by directly investing our money into their buildings, or just giving them money in general? I know they’ll certainly profit from the higher prices, but we don’t want them investing that money in something silly, like a healthcare system Stick Out Tongue    :p</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is at current no way to build in your custom unions/subjects nations outright in the game. While its something that has been considered its also something that deserves a bit more nuance than in Victoria 2 and its thus not been touched upon yet, though where it stands in regards to on release or at some point in the future is not my place to say. What you can do though is bankroll them through a diplomatic action to give them the funds to spend, and assuming that you create a high enough demand of X resource in your market they may seek to expand those resources depending on how much extra profit doing such can bring them.  </p>
<p>So right now primary means of engaging in such is limited but you do have secondary means of bankrolling and having the buy orders of your larger market motivate the AIs actions to build more industries and resource buildings to support you.</p>

<p>Assuming you have not been forced in by obligation or other diplomatic relationship you can just leave... though good luck to your economy in the rebalance.  </p>
<p>If you are the senior partner you can expel a junior partner, assuming they didn't utilize an obligation to enter themselves.  </p>
<p>This can be done peacefuly for the most part - though if you do just go to war with your senior partner you will suffer the same result.   </p>

<p>Two questions here:  </p>

<li>
<p>If obligations can be used to force smaller nations into customs unions, what are the possible actions of the junior partner who was forced into the union to leave the union? Can the junior partner leave the union right away? Is there a time limit or an influence cost?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can the junior nation worsen relations with the senior nation after being forced into a union to get booted from it? Is there a period before this kicks in? My example would be if Prussia forced Hamburg into a customs union with a Play or an Obligation and Hamburg was already at 0 or 1 positive relations with Prussia and started worsening relations to fall below 0 very soon after. What is the time frame that Hamburg manages to get booted from the Prussian customs union? Is this time frame different for obligations and Plays vs. normal offers?</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Currently its locked in like a truce timer, whether it stays like that who is to say.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty sure the obligation would force the nation to stay in until the timer was up and then relations would autobreak that engagement based on not meeting the relations requirement (makes notes to verify that later, again - just in case). Right now there is no timer to the customs union breaking but that's because we have been sitting on the understanding that as a player you would make notice of the diplomatic actions of X nation damaging relations with you, etc. I think this would be a good usage of our current situation/alert system though and will be writing up that suggestion.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 38 TRADE ROUTES { TARIFFS</font></p>
<p>​If money is the sinews of war, then trade is the lifeblood of nations and in no period is this truer than the Victorian Era. Victoria 3 takes place in a period of time where the nations of the world pushed this concept further than before, through a period of industrialization and growing interconnectivity of first homelands and colonies and then among nation-states themselves. The trade routes on the map connecting our nations became the fabric that underpins many of the understandings of our modern world today.  </p>
<p>But what is trade? It may seem obvious to some but to better understand the systems we need to make sure we understand the foundations they are built upon. Thus, trade is understood to be the movement of goods between two markets as a means of commercial transaction so that the other party is effectively paid for their services. Trade is not conducted between businesses and/or nations but is instead conducted through their national markets and by proxy their trade centers. While this may not seem a meaningful distinction, the market and economy of a nation is not synonymous with its national government; while that government may attempt to influence the economy it does not always have an absolute degree of control over it. Thus the trade that goes on in your market is something that you can influence and encourage (or discourage if you like) but never fully control (unless you are the only nation in existence I guess?).  </p>
<p>While trade takes place between national markets at the behest of players and AI, it is conducted in the trade centers of those respective countries. Trade centers function similarly to urban centers, talked about in a previous dev diary. These are not buildings that are constructed manually but develop as a result of their engaging in trade routes as they are representative of the many gray areas of industry that necessitate the collection and movement of goods.  </p>
<p>If you were to create an import route of goods for your industries, a resulting level of trade centers would develop within your nation. While urban centers tend to develop where you have placed many industrial buildings, trade centers develop in the market capitals and the ports of your nation. While you cannot paint the placement of trace centers outright, you can influence their development by creating ports in states that are naturally suited to such, where infrastructure and pops are readily available to staff them.  </p>
<p><em>Where there is a port and people, there is likely to be trade, and hopefully profit!</em>  </p>

<p>​Yes, trade centers must be staffed. Goods do not just appear in one nation from the next but require the maintenance of bureaucrats, laborers, clerks, and the like to offload and onload cargo, take account of it, tax it, and move it forward. These are for the most part privately owned enterprises that normally have capitalists in charge, instead of government run services. Without pops staffing your trade centers you will find yourself unable to conduct trade in accordance with your aspirations but that shouldn’t be too hard to manage as trade centers have also been historically known to be centers of migration, the first stop of migrants both domestic and international seeking a better life and sometimes finding it.  </p>

<p>​Trade centers collect revenue on both sides of the routes they manage, in relation to how many goods are moved and how much the routes affect the prices in their respective markets. This revenue is allocated to the employees and taxed by the same logic as any industry, so who makes money off your trade is related to your domestic policies in the same way as the rest of your economy.  </p>
<p>While trade is something every nation can take a part of, how they affect trade in relation to conducting it efficiently, preventing it when it hurts them, or profiting off of it when they can is dependent upon its trade policies, which also dictate how a nation can utiize embargoes and tariffs to achieve such. Yes that’s right, I said tariffs, cue historical excitement of the fanbase.  </p>

<p>​We’ve done a little restructuring of the economic laws in Victoria 3 since we wrote the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-7-laws.1483581/">Law dev diary</a>, where originally your economic system affected both your domestic and international situations. It has been broken into economic systems which now cover the domestic economy, and trade policy which covers your international endeavors. As such trade policy governs how you interact with a customs union, your ability to set embargoes and tariffs, as well as the general efficiency of your conducted trade.  </p>
<p><em>The Trade Policy laws are broken down into the four categories of ideology relative to the time period which interact with each of the economic systems you can put into place domestically.</em>  </p>

<p>​Embargos represent the ability of a national government to extend its influence in protecting its national market and subsequent interests. Most, if not all nations can engage in embargoing a good but their effectiveness of doing such is dependent upon the trade policy the national government is centered around. A government centered around the ideas of protectionism has an easier time implementing a more efficient embargo on goods vs those that are committed to a more mercantilism or free trade policy. Notice I said influence, not authority there? While it costs authority to enact taxes domestically it costs influence to place embargos as whether or not they are able to be enforced is dependent upon your ability to influence other nations to respect them. Refusing to make fair trade deals will strain your diplomatic corp.  </p>
<p><em>Protectionism means that not only are embargoes easier to maintain, they are also more efficient.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2338%20%E2%80%93%20Trade%20Routes%20%26%20Tariffs/DD38%2005.png"><img alt="DD38 05.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2338%20%E2%80%93%20Trade%20Routes%20%26%20Tariffs/DD38%2005.png" title="DD38 05.png" /></a></p>

<p>​And now for the potentially more controversial statement, embargoes are not absolute. Sure you may embargo trade of a specific good into your country but that’s not going to stop it outright, only hinder the ease of its trade. Another nation might try and continue to push goods into your country but it will certainly require more of an effort to facilitate such, it all depends. In history there’s certainly something we can agree upon, embargoing something, making it illegal, or hindering its trade reduces the flow of the good but does not stop it outright if there is a vested interest by another nation and a profit to be made.  </p>
<p>Tariffs are the means where a national government extends its influence as an intermediary in the trade between national markets, if not for the means of protecting its national interests, to at the very least ensure it gets its fair share of the profits that such entails. Tariffs are set on both exports and imports leaving the national economy because yes the government is interested in its fair share and if it cannot get the revenue by means of a consumption tax it will find other means. The ratio of this tariff level is dependent on the trade policy set. A more mercantilist trade policy would seek to ensure exports exceed imports so tariffs on exports will undoubtedly be lower. Protectionism is equal in its ratio as it seeks to shelter the domestic economy from booming or busting on either side of the equation. Free Trade, well free trade cares not for tariffs and seeks to profit through other means.  </p>
<p>While the laws set the tariff ratio of import/exports these can be customized further in the budget screen by setting their tax levels. Tax levels don’t just bring in revenues but offer incentives to your economic actors, your pops. Lower tariffs encourage trade while higher tariffs will hinder their efficiency because well if the nation is getting a bigger cut, how motivated can you expect the pop to be in engaging in such trade?  </p>
<p><em>A higher tariff means minimizing the profit to be had by business and disincentivizing trade.</em>  </p>

<p>​So how do treaty ports play into these systems, as they certainly existed during the time period? Treaty ports are a means to ensure that you have access to a national market despite such embargoes and tariffs. They are a wedge in the barriers to trade another nation may put up so the goods may be funneled out of the market. Treaty ports have the special function that they permit the bypassing of embargoes and tariffs set in land adjacent markets through trading. They are a more permanent means of opening the market to your access but in the same vein also require a more permanent investment. Since treaty ports are first and foremost ports they will certainly become trade centers and will require the infrastructure and staffing to function. As you invest in this profitable endeavor, be aware that you will need to protect such from the eyes of other imperialist nations who might seek to take it away from you.  </p>
<p><em>At game start Portugal finds itself holding the Treaty Port of Macao, a very profitable trade endeavor, but will such profits attract the attention of greater powers?</em>  </p>

<p>​How do Customs unions come into play here? If you recall from the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-37-market-expansion.1514692/">previous developer diary</a>, customs unions are an agreement between one or more nations where one nation agrees to subject itself to another's national market. By agreeing to subject your national market to another nation you are agreeing to take on the structure set into place by their economic system and policies. While you are still able to enact trade between that national market and another you lose the ability to set embargoes on specific goods and tariff policies across the market, though you do receive your contributing share of the profit of such tariffs. Sometimes this development can be beneficial, sometimes it can majorly hurt your national sources of income, as the previous dev diary goes to great length to summarize “it depends.”  </p>
<p>And that's a bit about trade, tariffs, and more! I may not have succeeded in delivering a concise explanation this time but it's certainly a shorter one. Next week is going to be the Kaiser himself (Johan Jons) to talk about Shipping Lanes. I’ll let the fanbase craft their own conspiracy theories about whether or not we are being literal with that one.</p>

<p>Tariffs are not currently set on specific goods they are set across the board as a policy of all traded goods. Thats the intent for now - going into calling out specific goods beyond that is something that was considered but has not been put into play.  </p>

<p>How are trade routes created by the player? You mention a player can create an import route of goods, but how is that done? Is it created through the Trade Centre itself, or is there a separate Trade window one sets routes up in, similar to HOI4?  </p>
<p>I also note that import routes have +/- buttons allowing one to adjust the size of them, but export routes lack that. Are exports then automatic?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its one of those things that you kinda just expect that others know about and apologies for not making that clear. Trade is done either through the market screen or the lens for trade on the bottom of the UI, you can choose to import/export a specific good and then the market you wish to get it from/send it to. This interaction will then create a trade center. It is then summarized for ease in the Trade Center Menu (though this UI exists in the Markets summary as well).  </p>

<p>In the Twitter Teaser Sulfur had a higher price in the US market, but still exported into the Texan Market. How does the Trade Center make a profit if the good its buying has a lower price at the goods destination then its source? Wouldn't the trade center lose money from the goods it's trading? and if so why would the traders continue trading?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, didn't see the teaser until now and yes looking at those numbers it seems like that would be a loss/loss trade (assuming that its not a bug that the 53 and 59 are reversed and thats where the profit is in the marginal revenue - Entirely feasible the game is under development after all and bugs are common). Took me awhile to answer this one only because I had to go back and run some marginal revenue calculations to assume I wasn't going crazy because its late here and I am tired.  </p>
<p>But lets assume that the trade is unprofitable, well that means there isn't profit to go to the trade centers, which means that they are conducting this trade at a loss. Now this loss may wash out in the many other profitable trades the trade center is conducting. Regardless to some degree this means that less profit is at the trade center, which means salaries are lower because profits are lower - if this was the only trade route well salaries would dry up - pops would look elsewhere for jobs and as a result of not being able to staff your trade center the trade route would not deliver goods.</p>

<p>That's a massive shame. Import substitution relies on high tariffs on finished goods and lower tariffs on intermediate goods and raw materials. I think in his report on manufactures, Hamilton already advises as much (although predating the game's time frame). Probably influenced by Friedrich List, the Zollverein in the 1840s also adopted higher tariffs on finished products while keeping tariffs on iron and other raw materials moderate.  </p>
<p>I could easily foresee dozens of scenarios in Victoria 3 where I want to fine tune my tariffs. How can I nourish my industrial base if I can only set tariffs across the board? Either I make everything expensive and nobody will be able to import raw materials and intermediate goods (and probably machines) to get my industry going or I make imports so cheap that it's not worth to produce these goods locally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While you are not wrong that it would be cool to utilize such features (maybe one day in the future) you are quoting mercantilist doctrine that is a bit early for the timeperiod. That is early colonialist of the late 1700s mercantilism where it was understood that colonies were only methods on which to access raw materials and the industrial metropoles were the intermediate and manufactured goods. Hamilton's advice was for the US to become its own "metropole" of the Western Hemisphere. While the Zollverein also touches on this its at the tail end of that variation of mercantilist thought with its founding - I will remind you that it did not stay an absolute of what you describe throughout its entire history and adapted as the times did. By the late 1800s its less the aquisition of materials which determines the progress of industrialization but the capturing of markets outright as a means to sell to fuel the means of industrialization. While Empires still fought over specific reasources of importance it was the ability to sell to the market that becomes the prevailing factor. Colonies could not just be places to extract resources from, they needed to be rich enough to buy the goods back. Mercantilism is a strange economic ideology because it honestly shifts in its understanding throughout the timeperiod instead of just being replaced by a newer idea?  </p>
<p>All this is to say economic thought changes, especially with politics because thats history and as I am quoted in the last dev diary saying "my god its hard to make a system to represent the fact that throughout history there's not always an agreed upon meaning (or many many outliers) when economics and politics get involved."  </p>
<p>Economic thoery tangent short: There are plenty of other ways in game to nourish your industrial base including subsidizes, encouraging consumption, and embargoing specific goods coming into your markets which are available to you. It might not be the exact level of detail you want this moment but it is there.  </p>
<p>And maybe oneday I will convince the devs to implement a more detailed tariff system.</p>

<p>The AI will have functions to determine that it should want to import a good because importing that good would let it build buildings that would then be profitable in the market.  </p>
<p>Trade routes can be setup in such a way that you cause quite crippling shortages in a market - that's why having a Protected Export Share or high tariff barriers can be important to protect your domestic industries. If there are more demands for export from a market than the market can actually provide, the relative competitiveness of each trade route determines who gets what share.</p>

<p>Not entirely. See the last dev diary for more details.  </p>
<p>National markets are the well... national market of X nation. A customs union is when two parties agree that one nation will subject its national market into another. The nation who's market remains is the senior parter, the one who subjects its market to the other is the junior partner. There can be multiple junior partners in a customs union.  </p>
<p>So a Custom's union is X number of countires who share a national market.</p>

<p>There's two principal issues:  </p>
<p>1) It overlaps with how embargos function in that it is a reactive (or proactive) tool to protect a specific good.  </p>
<p>2) Using embargoes in a proactive way would effectively be spending Influence on something that doesn't earn you any money, which wouldn't be a very good gameplay flow.  </p>
<p>Something we've considered is the ability to selectively make goods duty-free where you want to encourage their import/export.</p>

<p>Treaty Ports can be demanded from anyone. There's also some Treaty Ports at the start of the game, like Gibraltar and Melilla.</p>

<p>Trade can absolutely be wielded as a weapon. An example would be exporting their raw materials and flooding them with manufactured goods to destroy their domestic industries, especially if you acquire a Treaty Port or force them into adopting Free Trade so that they don't have too many tools to fight back with.</p>

<p>Does the AI really only take profitability of that specific goods into account when making such decions?

</blockquote>
<p>No, the AI doesn't just work on pure profit calculus. There's other factors that play into it as well, most importantly which economic strategy it's following. The important thing is that the AI is built with the intent that it should be able to <em>predict opportunities</em> instead of just being reactive - I'll go more into how this works in a later DD.</p>

<p>A further development of the tariff system would be really good. I feel like trade in its current form fails to tie itself to diplomacy as a game pillar, it seemingly lacks reactions. Trade during the 1800:s with the exception of the UK was reciprocal and bilateral , to my understanding, yet here trade policy seems to be an entirely internal unilateral proccess. Doesn't this system fail to model things like tariff wars, or diplomatic trade agreements like the Cobden-Chevalier agreement between the UK and France when you cannot diffentiate between nations?  </p>
<p>I don't want to be needlesly negative though. This is by far the best model for trade made in a paradox game so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trade Agreements are totally a thing within the diplomatic actions of the game and there are plenty of options you can take within diplomatic plays to pry open more walled off markets and get them to change their systems to better align with yours. While I am always on the lookout for how to tie trade further into the relations of diplomacy, what has been stated in the dev diary is not necessarily everything outright.</p>

<p>Having more than one treaty port (if managed) means that your trade centers will likely be balanced between the two ports which puts less stress on infrastructure and makes it easier to maintain a larger volume of trade. It also means more ports to defend so take it as you will.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 39 SHIPPING LANES</font></p>
<p>​Ave and welcome to another Dev Diary! I am Johan (No, the <em>other</em> Johan) a tech lead on Victoria 3 and today I will be talking about <strong>Shipping Lanes</strong>. It is an interesting addition to maritime empires in that there is now a cost to overseas possessions and sending a military expedition halfway across the globe is no longer as straightforward as in some older Paradox titles.  </p>
<p>But first we have to talk about <strong>Convoys</strong> which are an essential part in maintaining shipping lanes. They are produced from <strong>Ports</strong>, a government building which requires Clippers (or their era-equivalents) and possibly other goods.  </p>
<p>Each country has a set number of required convoys and not having enough will incur penalties on all shipping lanes. This may for example occur due to an overstretched colonial empire or hostile convoy raiders.  </p>
<p>Ports also fulfill an important role in connecting your overseas territories but more on that later.  </p>
<p><em>“Aha! I told you the Clipper factory was a good investment!”</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2339%20-%20Shipping%20Lanes/DD39%2001.png"><img alt="DD39 01.png" src="thumbs/Victoria%203%20-%20Dev%20Diary%20%2339%20-%20Shipping%20Lanes/DD39%2001.png" title="DD39 01.png" /></a></p>

<p>​<strong>Shipping Lanes</strong> represents port-to-port connections and are established for three different reasons:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Routes</strong> to an overseas market</li>
<li><strong>Supply Routes</strong> for an overseas General</li>
<li><strong>Port Connections</strong> to link states in a market</li>
</ul>
<p>Each shipping lane must have its own origin and destination port. Once established it will span across a number of sea nodes and have its own individual cost in convoys which adds up to the country’s total convoy requirement.  </p>
<p>It also tracks its own Effectiveness score which is based on the overall Supply Network strength (more on that later) and may be reduced by any local <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-24-navies-and-admirals.1498202/">convoy damage</a> done along the route.  </p>
<p>*While India provides Great Britain numerous benefits such as raw materials and population it is clear that the Crown Jewel of the British Empire is by no means cheap. A massive civilian and military naval industry is required to maintain it and keep it safe and thus it is by no means obvious whether such overseas possessions are always worth it.  </p>
<p>Note that UI and values are very much WIP.*  </p>

<p><strong>Trade Routes</strong> between two markets which do not share a common land border must be done overseas and will necessitate a shipping lane. Land adjacency is determined from where the two market capitals are located.  </p>
<p>The convoy cost is influenced by the number of sea nodes, quantity of goods and any goods-specific modifier (if any). The effectiveness affects the trade route competitiveness and by extension the quantity of goods shipped.  </p>
<p>It will use the two closest ports in the respective market capitals region. If either country lacks ports no overseas trade routes can be established.  </p>
<p><strong>Supply Routes</strong> are required when a general is sent to a front that is not reachable by land. It will use a friendly port connected by land to the generals headquarters and trace to the closest friendly port reachable from the front.  </p>
<p>The convoy cost is based on the number of sea nodes, battalions supplied and any general traits. Low effectiveness reduces supply status of the general and his troops. If a front is landlocked no generals can be sent there.  </p>
<p><em>Supplying troops over great distances is quite an enterprise. Rather than sending an expeditionary force from England all the way around the Cape to reach India perhaps Britain should consider building a standing army using either colonial settlers or locals?</em>  </p>

<p>​Lastly, <strong>Port Connections</strong> are a bit more complicated. In order for a state to access the goods within the market it needs to be able to trace a path back to the market capital. If this path requires it to go via the sea (meaning it is overseas) a shipping lane must be established to the market capital.  </p>
<p>This must be done for every state within the market including foreign ones. Rather than a single state having its own shipping lane a group of adjacent overseas states can form a cluster with a single exit port to the market capital - such as Bombay in the case of British India.  </p>
<p>This assumes such a port exists however. If the connection is severed from either end then the overseas states cannot access the market and thus forms its own isolated enclave. Likewise if the shipping lane effectiveness is strained it will lower the accessibility of goods to and from the overseas states. Reflect back on previous dev diaries and consider the cascading consequences that were to occur if a maritime empire reliant on its overseas possessions were to suddenly lose control of its shipping lanes.  </p>
<p>It is the market owner which must establish and pay for the port connections to all overseas market states. To somewhat compensate for this its subjects must share a portion of their convoys with their overlord. Subjects are still required to pay for their own trade and supply routes however.  </p>
<p>The convoy cost of a port connection is influenced by the number of sea nodes and the overseas infrastructure usage. By extracting your raw materials from overseas colonial plantations and mines, while the high-Infrastructure manufacturing industries producing finished goods are located near the market capital, you can keep your Port Connection cost down - though at the expense of the development and wealth of your colonies.  </p>
<p><em>Connecting India to the British market means it has to go all the way around the Cape to reach the British Isles which significantly impacts costs. But what if Britain somehow managed to discover a shortcut?</em>  </p>

<p>​And lastly when combining all the shipping lanes of a country we get its overall <strong>Supply Network</strong>. As outlined early on we derive its Strength score from the costs of all individual shipping lanes compared to the country's total supply.  </p>
<p>That is all for today! Hope you enjoyed this dev diary and in the words of Admiral John Fischer you may sleep easy in your beds. In next week's Dev Diary, Daniel will be back to tell us about how the Opium Wars are represented in the game.</p>

<p>"Convoys" are not to be thought of as goods as such and cannot be traded; they represent the <em>ability to move things overseas</em>, including the ship, crew, dockworkers, etc. Ports consume ships (Clippers or Steamers) and turn them into convoys. You <em>can</em> trade Clippers and Steamers with other markets, but you have to turn them into convoys through ports yourself - you cannot outsource your shipping lanes to another country (that would be best thought of as waiting for another country to export their goods to / import your goods from your market).  </p>
<p>Regarding ports being government owned with no option to privatize them like railways, we agree that's a bit suboptimal - having Port-based trading companies make big bucks selling goods transport to Trade Centers who make clever decisions whether it's cheap enough to buy them given the profit of the routes they manage etc sounds really neat, but also <em>one step too far</em> in complexity at the moment. Your supply network is crucial for your ability to operate an intercontinental empire, and seeing your overseas expeditionary forces go undersupplied because some Pops on the other side of the world decided to switch to coffee instead of tea, bringing the profit of trade centers and thereby ports down below the point where they can offer competitive wages with your Steel Mills... well, it <em>sounds</em> cool, but is not a UX challenge we want to try to tackle at this time.</p>

<p>It's a result of the players actions (sending a general overseas, setting up a trade route or building ports in overseas territory). The actual shipping lane path is the shortest/lowest cost possible.  </p>

<p>Looks great! Really a big improvement over vic2's logistic system... one that doesn't even exist Stick Out Tongue    :p  </p>
<p>Based on the dev diary I have two questions because two things are not entirely clear to me:  </p>
<ul>
<li>What happens what a country in a customs union (partially) loses its connection to the market capital? Lets take Canada as an example. What happens if the connection to London is severed? Does 'forming an enclave' mean that every state becomes isolated or that Canada functionally leaves the British market to form its own market? What happens if the connection only is partially disrupted?</li>
<li>Do all subjects have to share convoys with the senior member of the market, or only if they're overseas? If the first is the case, wouldn't Prussia have an overflow of convoys, while Britain would be at a relative disadvantage?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, great dev diary. Really cool stuff and completely clear to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the connection is severed Canada is isolated from the British market and must rely on local goods and prices. Likewise the rest of the British market cannot access Canadian goods. No new market is automatically created but Canada can of course leave the British market and form their own should they wish.  </p>
<p>A partially disrupted connection lowers Market Access. For example at 50% market access then the price of Wheat is based on 50% off the british market and 50% of the local price.  </p>

<p>Great dev diary, although I can't wait to see how it works in combination with other aspects of gameplay (mostly naval warfare....).  </p>
<p>Two questions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>You said that you can't send troops by sea to landlocked fronts. But say GB needs to send your army to quell a colonial rebellion in Niger, and Nigeria has a "friendly port". The frontline will be landlocked, but how can British troop even reach it if not by sea?</li>
<li>
<p>How do ports work to establish market access between places that are also connected by land? Say that my sulfur from Sicily needs reach Naples where the explosive factory is located. Appennines in Sicily and Calabria make it hard to develop "land" infrastructure (I am here positing that the Messina Strait is considered as a "land" connection) - but sending them by sea would make much more sense, at least until the railway infrastructure is developed enough*. How would road, railway and port infrastructure combine in determining the market access?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spoiler alert - it is still not very developed even as of today</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If British troops can reach the Niger front from the friendly port in Nigeria then it's fine.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsure how a mixed scenario would work, perhaps <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/669315/">@lachek</a> can explain this one  </p>

<p>It seems pretty clear that distance (# of sea nodes) and bulkiness (quantity) would play a part in how costly in convoys any trade route would be.</p>

<p>For example one unit of Automobiles consumes more convoys than one unit of Wheat. These are scriptable for each goods.</p>

<p>If I don't have enough convoys, can I prioritize certain routes to lower or remove penalties on that route, at the cost of raising the penalties on others? For example, if I have two trade routes that each want 100 convoys, but I only have 150 convoys, that would mean that each route would only get 75 convoys from their desired 100. What I am curious about is if I can steal convoys from one route for the other, so that one route has 100/100 convoys, while the other only has 50/100. I could see wanting to do this while at war, for example, to prioritize the supply line, or if one trade route is bringing the materials I need to build more convoys, I definitely would not want to not get everything I could from that route.  </p>
<p>Could it be possible to trade "through" other countries if your country is landlocked, with the country the goods are passing through getting tariffs or transportation fees or something?</p>

<p>Some more questions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Will the sealanes (their locations, throughput, speed of delivery) be affected by weather / primary sea winds and currents? IRL until steamships took over completely shipping routes were dictated by winds and currents. Sailing ships went with the wind, not along a shortest direct lines between two points. See Brouwer route or Clipper route for more info.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the sealanes and ports and trade routes in general be affected by season and weather? For example Saint-Petersburg port freezes in winter and until arrival of reliable icebreakers commerce stopped for cold months. In connection with previous questions - some trade winds are seasonal.  </p>

<li>
<p>Will ports be logistical hubs only? Will there be separate buildings for fishing / seafood gathering / whaling / corals gathering / pearls gathering and other maritime pursuits?  </p>

<p>Will ports provide revenue per visiting ships to represent harbour fees and other multitude of services provided in ports to ships (repair, fuelling, provisioning, R&amp;R for the crews)?</p>

<p>Thanks for the response,so to clarify,is there a delay to produce convoys?If it's the case,this means that if you can't have enough clippers or Steamers,you can have an unavoidable shortage of convoys if you don't plan on long term.I really hope so.It would be great.Can you confirm it's the case?  </p>
<p>Thanks for any replies about this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there's a Shortage of Clippers or Steamers, the output of your Ports will suffer as well - so not only will it be more expensive to run them but the number of convoys produced as a result will also be decreased. Remember though that there are no stockpiles, so there's no "delay" as such - as soon as your Convoy demand increases above your output your shipping lanes will start suffering penalties, and as soon as your demand for Clippers or Steamers outstrips the supply by such a degree there's a shortage you will start to see compounding output penalties.</p>

<p>Can't you at least make the private sector pay for the convoys through the investment pool or something? It makes no sense that the state is paying for the transportation of goods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logical purchaser of convoy services for Trade Routes would be Trade Centers, not the investment pool - otherwise you might end up in a weird situation where all the trade being done is imports of Clothes while the people paying for these routes are Aristocrats running Grain Farms not involved in international trade at all. But there are two other types of Shipping Lanes as well, and those are best considered purchased by the government (supplying troops overseas and connecting overseas states into the market).  </p>
<p>But the source of the money is not the problem, it's about exposing the causality chain to the player and giving them the tools to deal with it. As <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/1250737/">@KaiserJohan</a> has discussed elsewhere in these comments, the ability to prioritize shipping lanes would help address some of that. But this would also introduce a <em>horrendous</em> degree of micro to execute strategies that in 90% of cases are obvious (prioritize port connections and military supplies) and in 9% of cases are incredibly obtuse for little payoff (where in the priority ladder should Porcelain imports be compared to Coal exports?). Very few cases would end up actually being Interesting Choices, as opposed to busywork to fix the simulation manually. Since it'd require an extensive amount of work on both gameplay logic and new UIs to give the player these tools we've decided to just make Ports government owned for the moment, since it creates the gameplay dynamic we want (=maintaining trade and an overseas presence can be very lucrative but also necessitates extensive infrastructure and tall production chains, which can leave you vulnerable to instability). As we've mentioned elsewhere in the past, our long-term aim is to make as many buildings privately owned as possible without hurting gameplay.</p>

<p>The initiator of the route pays for shipping the goods, no matter which direction the goods move in. The "partners" in this case are not the countries but the Pops in the Trade Centers on both sides. The work done by the "recipient" Trade Center does help maintain the route's efficiency but does not impact its convoy cost, since they're not the ones sending ships out. In return those Pops get a share of the route's profit.  </p>
<p>Not to get ahead of dev diary schedule here, but as an example, consider the East India Company exporting Opium to China. China is not a "partner" in this trade by any means and is doing everything it can to <em>curtail</em> the trade. But there are still people working on the other end to receive and distribute the Opium that does land in China, and they make some money off this trade even though they're not in any way contributing to the convoy cost of the route.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Employment level and supply chain complexity. Employment level can be fixed with subsidies, yes, the main question is <em>when would you ever turn them off?</em> There are extremely few cases where you'd ever be OK with <em>not</em> having full Port employment. Since that means you have to cover any shortfall anyway, that means the only mechanical advantage to you (the player) to have Ports operate independently is that if they're making enough from Trade Centers buying their services, you don't have to pay their operating costs.  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>However</em>, this means these cost will be borne by Trade Centers instead, meaning you have to babysit your trade routes more to ensure they remain profitable - otherwise the interplay between Trade Centers and Ports could turn into an extremely hard to troubleshoot death spiral, where there aren't enough Convoys to do efficient Trade and Trade isn't profitable enough to buy Convoys. If in practice these problems are so difficult to manage that you just turn on the "subsidize" buttons on every building type involved in the trade supply chain and then just poke at them to try to bring your total marginal cost down a bit, there's no real advantage to it compared to making only the terminus of the supply chain (Ports) government owned and the other buildings private.  </p>
<p>In addition, since Shipping Lanes created for reasons other than Trade Routes (military supply and port connections) <em>should</em> actually be state expenses, having all Convoys bought by Trade Centers is also non-immersive. To fix that you'd need some way of having the state buy goods from the market directly, which likely means the player should be able to determine what price they're willing to pay for those goods, as this would be what calibrates the economy of the privately owned building supplying it. Since choosing the amount you're paying a building for its services freely in order to ensure it's profitable enough to not fail to provide you with those services is essentially a roundabout way of subsidizing it (something I've discussed at length elsewhere on the forum) this would be a whole new system to replicate the functionality of an existing one, only in the service of making the mechanic feel a tad more true-to-life.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not sure what you mean by "free" here. Ports cost both materials and labor to operate, just like every other building. That cost is just borne by the treasury directly rather than by other buildings or Pops.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you mod ports to be a privately owned building, it's going to need a source of revenue to operate. This means you have to add a (non-tradeable) market good for it to sell, preferably to Trade Centers. You <em>may</em> be able to turn Convoys into this kind of market good directly even though it also acts as a capacity with other mechanics associated with it, but it'd probably be easier for balancing to make it a separate good. You'd then have to rebalance Trade Centers to ensure they remain profitable enough after buying this new product that they can pay competitive wages. All this is perfectly doable, but like I said in #1 above, I'm pretty sure you'll find that you're going to want to subsidize all buildings involved by default as a result, leading to slightly less compelling gameplay with more complexity. But YMMV!  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current build this would do nothing other than reduce the cost of the goods the building sold - it wouldn't actually improve your treasury balance or even the building's internal economy, since wages are fixed and it's assumed that government buildings do not provide revenue to offset its costs. Having government-owned buildings at least be able to offset its operating expenses by providing goods &amp; services for sale sounds like cool modding functionality though, it's very likely something we'll support in the future.</p>

<p>Ports provide some Infrastructure to the state it's built in, increasing its overall connection to the market. But we don't model the transportation of Sulfur from Sicily to the Chemical Industry in Naples directly, and intra-market trade does not cost Convoys unless it's connecting two state clusters. Sicily is connected via a strait so there's no port-to-market Shipping Lane connection required.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 40 OPIUM WARS</font></p>
<p>Good evening, and welcome to this week’s instalment of the Victoria 3 Dev Diaries! To cap off this month’s theme of trade, I’ll be talking about the Opium Wars and introducing the concepts of Cultural Obsessions and Religious Taboos.  </p>
<p>In the 1830’s China was ravaged by opium addiction. The impact was severe and broad in its effects, with myriad social, economic and even military consequences. Despite attempts by the Qing government to restrict imports, British merchants continued to illegally flood the market. The situation came to a head when Qing officials ordered the seizure and destruction of opium in Canton, to which the British responded with force - the First Opium War resulted in crushing defeats for the Qing government and began an era of unfavourable and humiliating treaties with the Western powers.  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3 we represent the Opium Wars through Journal Entries and Events. Qing China begins in the midst of this crisis, but it is also possible for other unrecognised countries to experience this content if the in-game conditions are appropriate.  </p>
<p><em>The Opium Crisis event applies harsh negative modifiers to Standard of Living throughout your country, to your Mortality Rate, and to the effectiveness of your military forces.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2340%20-%20Opium%20Wars/opiumwarsstart.png"><img alt="opiumwarsstart.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2340%20-%20Opium%20Wars/opiumwarsstart.png" title="opiumwarsstart.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Opium Crisis WIP Event in Beijing Opium addiction is ravaging Great Qing: Vast numbers of Han people have become opium fiends, causing a wave of crime, poverty, and idleness. Despite the obvious harm, ZK Great Britain continues to flood the market: household has a bed-bound opium fiend, every street corner has an opium den, and port welcomes British merchants pouring a glut of opium down the throats of any who will pay for it. We have to do something' We cannot risk the ire of ZK Great Britain. Every every</font></p>
<p>This is a good time to talk a little more about Cultural Obsessions. A culture can become obsessed with a specific Good - Pops of that Culture, regardless of where they are in the world, will spend significantly more on Goods they are obsessed with compared to other goods in the same <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-13-standard-of-living.1489327/">Pop Needs</a> category. So in the case of Opium in China, Han pops will spend a lot more of their wealth buying Opium than they do on Liquor or Tobacco. This naturally drives up demand for Opium, and therefore makes it more expensive within the Chinese market. The foreign powers selling Opium to China are making a killing exploiting this demand and feeding the addiction. Cultures can develop new Obsessions over time, and you’ll need to react to changes in pop demands as a result.  </p>
<p>On a mechanically related note (though unrelated to the Opium Wars), Religions have Taboos against certain goods. For instance Muslim faiths have a Taboo against the consumption of Liquor and Wine. This has the opposite effect from a Cultural Obsession - pops following these religions will spend much less on purchasing that Good compared to other Goods in that category. So Muslims will typically buy Tobacco and Opium instead of Liquor, and they will buy Tea or Coffee instead of Wine. Just as in real life, not everybody completely adheres to the tenets of their faith, and so these act as powerful modifiers on purchasing decisions rather than total “bans” on consumption. Unlike Obsessions, Taboos are static throughout the game.  </p>
<p><em>Beijing is one of the most populated States in the world in 1836. Besides its 19 million people, it is also home to the Forbidden City Monument, a massive Government Administration sector, as well as a large section of the now defunct Great Wall.</em>  </p>

<p>Back to the Opium Wars!  </p>
<p>If China (or whichever country is the target, but we’ll keep things simple and refer to China from here on out) chooses to confront the issue head on, the Opium Crisis Journal Entry will describe the conditions for successfully resolving the issue, as well as the conditions that will cause immediate failure. China must avoid at all costs enacting the Free Trade law as well as resist the attempts of the Great Powers to establish a Treaty Port - both of these are potential war goals which the AI will strongly prioritize when starting Diplomatic Plays against China. While resisting the Western powers, China must maintain a total ban on the Opium trade.  </p>
<p><em>Playing as Great Britain (or any major opium exporter), you'll have the opportunity to thwart the opium ban through all the usual diplomatic and coercive means at your disposal. It could even be an opportunity to make inroads into China.</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Opium Wars WIP Event in Home Counties The government has announced its intent to put an end to the opium trade in Great Qing: As Zk Cambridge Great Britain is major exporter of opium, this is a matter of great economic concern: "There are some who the so-called moral evils of the opium trade; say to them, who are You to stand in the way of free trade and the free choices of the consumer? The 23 London demand exists, and so we provide if not us then some other nation would grow rich off the backs of Han opium fiends: Should every man be deprived of opium simply because some irresponsible ninnyhammers abuse it? And should every British family be deprived of the wealth that opium brings to our country? They will eat their and they will like it! British Relations towards Great  Qing deteriorates by 30 Adds Opium Wars to the Journal of &gt;x Great Britain We have other matters to attend to. Qing decry opium</font></p>
<p>China’s attempts to halt the flow of opium will not go unchallenged. All Great and Major powers exporting Opium to China will receive an event prompting them to decide their stance on the matter - though there is some chance that they will let the issue slide, it is much more likely that they will take an opposing stance. This will add the Opium Wars Journal Entry to that country, in which their success conditions match the failure conditions for China. Opium-trading countries must either force China to adopt the Free Trade law, or else acquire a Treaty Port in that nation that allows them to bypass goods bans. Rather than immediately creating a Diplomatic Play with predefined war goals, the AI (and indeed the player!) is strongly encouraged to start a Play with wargoals that would complete the Journal Entry.  </p>
<p><em>Free from the ravages of opium addiction and the interference of froeign powers, the strengthened Qing dynasty might avoid or avert the crises that would historically bring them to ruin.</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Yichang The End of Addiction WIP Event in Beijing We have broken the Han dependence on opium through great perserverance: Not even the machinations of ZK Great Britain could prevent uS from returning good health and prosperity to Great Qing: Just as the opium fiend shall break his addiction and rise from his idler s bed, so shall our nation cast off the unwelcome of foreign influence and rise as sovereign state. No inundated with opium; our rivers shall flow with silver and our people shall return to virtuous The sovereignty of_&amp; Great is absolute.

<p>If China succeeds in suppressing the flow of opium while withstanding the onslaught of the Great Powers, the course of history is altered and the addiction crisis will be resolved. All its primary cultures will lose their Opium Obsession, and the negative modifiers representing the effects of widespread addiction will be removed. With foreign powers repulsed, China has not been forced into the unequal treaties that would lead to further conflict and turmoil.  </p>
<p><em>Fragile Unity is the “broadest” Journal Entry in Victoria 3, encompassing content that can emerge at all stages of the game - for instance while the stage is already set for the Opium Wars in 1836, the Boxer Rebellion will not happen until later in the game when a stronger sense of Han nationalism has appeared.</em>  </p>

<p>Failure, however, may have dire consequences. The government will lose Legitimacy, Radicals will rise across the nation, and Turmoil will engulf your states. But that is not the worst of it; failing the Opium Wars Journal Entry increases your fragmentation, tracked by the Fragile Unity Journal Entry. If your fragmentation rises to 100%, it will herald the end of a unified China, with the nation breaking up into a dozen warlord states. Failing the Opium Wars Journal Entry will indirectly lead to an influx of missionaries into China which may spark radical uprisings on a scale never seen before. And if exploitative foreign presence in China continues into the era of Han nationalism, the people’s demands for sovereignty will shake the foundations of the state and threaten the survival of the Qing Dynasty. One great failure can lead to a chain reaction of disaster.  </p>
<p>That’s all for today! Next week we’ll be moving on from trade to a month of focus on the theme of strife. Join us next week where Mikael Andersson will introduce Victoria 3’s Revolutions.</p>

<p>Only Religions have Taboos in V3.  </p>
<p>It's a check to see if Qing has ever been bankrupt - though if you've gone bankrupt 5 times in a row you don't need a journal entry to tell you that something has gone very wrong.  </p>

I feel like most of the ones showed off only provide the player two options max. Are there going to be events that provide more options than that? I would think it might limit where players can take things if they only have two ways to respond to something happening.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: GAv 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 41 REVOLUTIONS MAISON</font></p>
<p>​A glorious Thursday to you! Today we will finally get into details of what fate befalls the state that fails to deliver what its people demand - revolution!  </p>
<p>Revolutions in Victoria 3 can be seen as a result of failure in the game’s economic and political core loops. When this happens it means you have failed to balance the material and ideological desires of the different segments of your population, resulting in one or several groups deciding to take matters in their own hands. The result is a tremendous upheaval which could go very wrong for you - but play your cards right, and there’s a chance you might bounce back from this crisis even stronger than before.  </p>
<p>A design goal we have kept front and center is that outright armed uprisings should be <em>rare</em> but still feel <em>threatening</em>. There is a lot of foreshadowing and opportunity to course-correct or compensate if you want to avoid a revolution. Not all movements will actually be powerful or angry enough to pose a real threat to you, and if they aren’t, they won’t drag you into a pointless war with an obvious outcome but bide their time until they become relevant.  </p>
<p>A revolution always starts with a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-14-political-movements.1490045/">Political Movement</a> demanding some kind of change to the country’s <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-7-laws.1483581/">Laws</a>. The demand might be to enact something novel (<em>perhaps Universal Suffrage or Workplace Safety</em>), preserve something you’re about to change (<em>maybe the Monarchy you’ve been trying to abolish</em>), or restore something you used to have (<em>Free Markets? Outlawed Dissent?</em>). Any of these could end in a violent uprising if the movement is radical enough and you fail to meet its demands.  </p>
<p>Political Movements have two major attributes to keep an eye on: their <em>Support</em> and their <em>Radicalism</em>. A movement’s Support affects how much help they would lend to enacting their desired change if you choose to go along with them, or how much resistance they put up in case of a movement to preserve a law you’re trying to change. It also determines how powerful a revolution they can muster, should it come down to that.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Radicalism measures how <em>likely</em> they are to revolt if they don’t get their way. A movement with strong Support and high Radicalism is of course very dangerous. A movement with strong Support but low Radicalism can be a nuisance but is relatively harmless: they’ll work within the system, maybe raise a placard or two, but won’t take up arms. Finally, a movement with low Support but high Radicalism might not stand much of a chance to overthrow the government on their own, but the instability caused by their ideological fervor could be damaging to your country in the short-term and might even create geopolitical opportunities for your neighbors.  </p>
<p><em>The movement to restore the Republic is not the most powerful one, but those who </em><em>do</em><em> support it care a great deal - and may even be willing to lay down their lives for it. It is supported by both the Armed Forces and the Intelligentsia - not the most likely of bedfellows typically, but united in this case for this particular cause.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2341%20-%20Revolutions/DD41%2001.png"><img alt="DD41 01.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2341%20-%20Revolutions/DD41%2001.png" title="DD41 01.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Political Movements Restore Presidential Republic Support: 21 Radicalism: 103 204K</font></p>
<p>​A movement’s Radicalism originates from two sources: the number of Radicals among the Pops that support the movement, and the Clout of supporting <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Interest Groups</a> with Approval low enough to be Angry. Since an Interest Group’s Approval originates both from the Laws of your country and also how Loyal vs Radical its supporters are, Radical Pops can potentially double their impact on a movement’s Radicalism. The major difference between these two factors is that when Pops act through their Interest Groups their impact is through Clout (the national share of their Political Strength) while direct Pop support makes a difference through sheer numbers. This means populist uprisings are possible even though the affected Pops don’t have any real representation in the halls of power, assuming they’re angry enough about their living conditions.  </p>
<p>While a movement’s demands remain unmet, any Pops that belong to them will gradually gain Radicals. Once the Radicalism of a movement has exceeded a certain threshold it will begin organizing an armed uprising. You can monitor this progression in your outliner to see both how rapidly you’re moving along the road to revolution and how far you have already gone, both determined by Radicalism.  </p>
<p>This means you can have a direct impact on revolutionary progression. Of course you can cave to the movement’s demands, which will placate them and eventually cause them to disband. But you can also address the problem by identifying the troublemakers and deal with them directly: either deradicalize them by improving their living conditions, or suppressing their contrarian ways by other means.  </p>
<p><em>The ability to deal with insurgents by issuing Decrees to suppress Radicals can be a helpful tool in more authoritarian countries with concentrated populations, or where the insurgency is very localized. This is much more difficult in case of broadly supported populist movements in a large country.</em>  </p>

<p>​If you manage to get the movement’s Radicalism under control, you can make the revolution fizzle out on its own without giving an inch.  </p>
<p>Another way of keeping revolutions in check is by establishing a Home Affairs Institution. By sinking Bureaucracy into Home Affairs you can more easily keep your troublesome elements in check, giving you more room to maneuver politically. As usual such an Institution can take several forms depending on what Law establishes it. A National Guard can require you to take more overt, proactive steps to keep law and order, while a Secret Police is able to operate more effectively in the background.  </p>
<p><em>A minimal Home Affairs Institution under the Secret Police Law.</em>  </p>

<p>​When radical movements are met with obstacles to their revolution for a long time, there’s an increasing chance that its revolutionary fervor burns out and the movement disbands.  </p>
<p>But let’s say you don’t manage to placate or obstruct the political movement and the revolutionary progression boils over a required threshold. In this case an armed uprising will take a number of your states, proportional to the strength of the movement and localized roughly where its supporters are, to form a new revolutionary country. This country has the same technology as you but with some differences in laws, to reflect the ideological desires of the political movement’s leadership. Furthermore, the Interest Groups in this new country will become marginalized if they do not support the revolution, while the opposite is true in the loyalist part of the country.  </p>
<p>Obviously, characters supporting revolutionary Interest Groups will join the revolution. This includes not only Interest Group leaders, but also those Generals and Admirals you may have carefully nurtured over many military campaigns and who may by now be in charge of most of your forces. Even if you win against them, they won’t be making it back to your country - alive, at least.  </p>
<p>All other properties of this new country are dependent on the states they won over. If the revolution takes all your Barracks and Arms Industries, you might be in big trouble; if the revolutionary states consist mostly of Paper Mills and Art Academies, maybe you’re not so worried (until your Government Administrations start grinding to a halt and your aristocracy get mad about the lack of culture workers to patronize, that is). And of course, the loyalist part of the country retains all their hard-won diplomatic pacts and treaties, while the pretender has to start from scratch.  </p>
<p>What follows is a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-21-diplomatic-plays.1495892/">Revolutionary [Diplomatic] Play</a> where the stakes are very simple: the loyalist part of the country tries to crush the rebellion, while the revolutionary country tries to swarm the loyalists. Other countries with an Interest in the region can participate in this Play as usual. It is not uncommon for countries with good relations to the country before the revolution to support the loyalists in restoring order. It is also possible for a country whose government supports the ideals of the revolutionaries to back their side. As such, a revolution might not only result in you having to fight and kill your own people, but your nation might even become the ideological battleground of Great Powers.  </p>
<p><em>A revolution in South Germany might prove a perfect opportunity for some old rivals to weaken each other and perhaps woo a potential Subject nation without having to take on any Infamy of their own.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2341%20-%20Revolutions/DD41%2004.png"><img alt="DD41 04.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2341%20-%20Revolutions/DD41%2004.png" title="DD41 04.png" /></a></p>

Attacker Defender Belligerents Wargoals Wargoals Belligerents 14 10 Annex Annex Switzerland Revolutionary 255 Switzerland 150 10 10 To Arms! Stamp</font></p>
<p>​If the prospect of winning against the revolutionaries doesn’t look good, like in all Diplomatic Plays you have the option of giving up. But rather than simply backing down and letting the revolutionaries have their way (which, to be frank, you could and should have done a long time ago if that was your intention), in Revolutionary Plays you only have an option to switch sides and take over the revolutionary part of the country in its fight against the loyalists. A daring player might decide to manufacture a powerful revolution on purpose in order to push some highly contentious laws through, though this strategy definitely straddles the line between brilliance and madness.  </p>
<p>It’s important to note that there is no potential for a “white peace” in a revolution. Either side can capitulate, of course, but a peace cannot be signed without one party pressing their war goal and annexing the other side. By the end of the revolution, only one country will be left standing.  </p>
<p>Needless to say, while all <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-25-the-cost-of-war.1499389/">wars are expensive</a>, civil wars are doubly so. A quick and decisive victory with minimal casualties is the best you can hope for - a long, drawn-out war amassing casualties and devastation on both sides might result in a country so broken it will take decades to rebuild. But once the war is over, the Interest Groups that lost the power struggle are defeated, for a time. Perhaps during this “golden age” you will have the opportunity to effect some much-needed political change and rise from the ashes?  </p>
<p>Losing a revolutionary war means your country loses all its territory and Pops, in other words Game Over. This is something we’ve gone back and forth on during development, because while we do want you to be able to drastically transform your country through revolution, we don’t want to encourage you to just give up if things are looking bleak because resisting means a prolonged conflict leading to a more war-torn country in the end. So pick your side, but do it carefully! Should you end up losing after all, just like in any Game Over situation you can choose to continue playing as a different country, including the political faction that just took over yours. But to be clear, we still haven’t fully made our mind up on this and might well change our mind again! What do you think? Feel free to let us know in the comments!  </p>
<p>Next week I’ll return with part two of civil wars: cultural secessions. Until then!</p>

<p>About the game over thing for revolts,if you are not playing on IronMan,can you confirm that you will be able to continue in observer mode and/or select a new country as in all recent Paradox Games or you haven't decided yet for that and there is still a chance you implement it the CK2/VIC2 way where you are completely locked from continuing the game,even in a non-ironman or non-multiplayer game?  </p>
<p>Can Turmoil and radicalism be modified by some country,pop,states or Interest Group Modifiers?  </p>
<p>Thanks for any replies about this.</p>

<p>Can definitely confirm that outside of Ironman you'll be able to keep playing, as Observer or any country still on the map, after Game Over.  </p>
<p>Radicalism Gain modifiers from various factors (such as decreases in Standard of Living or from being Discriminated) can be individually applied on a Country or State level where they would affect the relevant Pops (we don't apply modifiers to Pops directly as they're too mutable ) and are fully available to modders. We're considering implementing them on Interest Group level as well.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Russia will share the country definition (i.e. RUS) of loyalist Russia, but there are ways of altering its behaviors or appearance based on its revolutionary nature. So for example, in the country definition file for RUS you could say "The name of your country is Russia, unless you're Revolutionary, in which case if the Rural Folk are Revolutionary your name is Russian Agrarian Uprising, or... ". You can also change flags the same way.</p>

<p>This is <em>very</em> unclear in the dev diary, mostly because of a bug that inverted its logic that didn't get quashed until after the screenshot was made. Oops!    :oops:  </p>
<p>Basically the threshold is the level where, if Radicalism is currently below this level you're safe, while if Radicalism is above it it's only a matter of time until the uprising.</p>

<p>I am disappointed that a revolutionary play can't move into an independence play.

<p>However, there was to my knowledge no <em>sincere</em> talk in the CSA's halls of power for forcing the USA as a whole to accept slavery, nor was the USA at the start all that interested in forcing the abolishment of slavery. That was actually a later development.</p>

<p>On the topic of the ACW and CSA, we consider this a special case that shares elements of both Revolution and Secession mechanics. We'll cover this more later on, but it has not been forgotten about or misrepresented within these Revolution mechanics.</p>

<p>That sounds good but what about simple coups within the elite that don't tear the whole country apart ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, coups are an interesting design challenge actually because nobody wants to just Game Over with no warning just because they lost track of their military for a couple months, yet that's basically the whole point of coups. Smile    :)  </p>
<p>There are two mechanics in the game that duplicate what a coup does in practice:  </p>
<p>1) An Interest Group gets so powerful and cranky that a player realizes they cannot ignore them, and is forced to put them in charge to prevent a revolution.  </p>
<p>2) A revolution breaks out that the player feels they can't win, so they Capitulate to it, Game Over, and switch country to prevent too much bloodshed.  </p>
<p>You can of course roleplay these as a coup, but to be honest none of them really have the "feel" of one. However, since they fill the role of what a coup actually does we'd need to come up with unique and compelling mechanics for them so they're not just yet another way to create the same effect. So for the moment, coups are not represented in the game other than through things like assassination events.</p>

<p>Sadly no, there's no support for that at present and things tend to be chaotic enough without simultaneous counter-revolutions. Something I'd love to explore in the future but right now it would conflict with some fundamental rules around Diplomatic Plays.</p>

<p>A Political Movement is only for one particular Law, but if a revolution actually breaks out into its own country over not getting that, the revolutionaries change not only that Law but also some other ones on their wishlist while they're at it. If they win the war, those Laws remain in place, so a larger political shift than was originally intended may be on the table in that case.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Revolutions and Political Movements in general are less common when there's a lot of political apathy, which is inversely related to Literacy and Standard of Living, so if you're playing a very rural, low-tech, low-wealth society you're going to be more capable of managing your politics than if you're an industrialized Great Power. You can also dodge a lot of political conflict by refraining from enacting new Laws since this is often what triggers backlash. You can also be purely reactive in your law enactments, waiting for supporting movements to demand them before embarking on passing them. So yeah, a skilled player can avoid the threat of revolution by being risk-averse, but might also fall behind other nations by being risk-averse.</p>

<p>The territory taken by the revolution at the start of the uprising scales with Clout (Support, actually, but that's based on Clout), and the size of the army they get is based on what territory they get. Revolutions also get a temporary boost to Conscription Rate, so can raise more civilians in their cause (for obvious reasons) than the loyalist country can.</p>

<p>You can only switch once.  </p>
<p>Once Revolution is on the way you can't cheese it by disbanding commanders and downsizing barracks etc. Also revolutionary country has access to special conscription centers so even if there was no barracks there they can still pack a punch.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 42 CULTURAL SECESSIONS</font></p>
<p>​Welcome back to another chapter in this rundown of features that might tear your lovely nation apart! Last week we discussed <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-41-revolutions.1519120/">Revolutions</a>, which is where politically engaged members of your society rise up to change your country in favor of a certain Law. Today we will discuss another type of Civil War: Cultural Secessions, which is where Pops in your nation of a certain culture demand their right to self-determination and carve out their own country from yours. These types of Civil Wars have some similarity in mechanics but ultimately serve two very different purposes.  </p>
<p>Just like revolutions can be seen as a failure to balance the economic and political needs of different classes against each other, secessions can be seen as a failure to see to the needs of Pops of certain cultures within your borders. Often this can come about as the result of aggressive expansion or systematic oppression of Pops of certain cultures (or indeed, the religions commonly associated with those cultures). Just like revolutions there are several paths to go down in order to deal with the problems secessionists might cause.  </p>
<p>Back in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-17-migration.1492928/">Migration</a> dev diary we briefly mentioned a mechanic called Turmoil. Turmoil is the effect of having too many Radicals in your country, and has effects both on the state level and on entire cultures worldwide. To understand cultural secessions we have to understand Turmoil a bit better first.  </p>
<p>Turmoil measures social friction and conflicts between Pops. This can include crime, violence, angry protests, and more. When a substantial part of a state’s total population are made up of Radicals, Turmoil is created and negative effects start to be applied: there’s a certain amount of Tax Waste, modeling all the different costs of the types of unrest Turmoil represents; and the state’s migration attraction decreases substantially, because nobody wants to move to an area where trouble is brewing  </p>
<p><em>Louisiana appears to be going through some difficulties. Could that be a slave revolt brewing?</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP atayette Turmoil Turmoil from Radical 31.34% ~o% Migration Attraction +25.0% Tax Waste Pops:</font></p>
<p>As you might recall from the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-14-political-movements.1490045/">Political Movements</a> dev diary, Radicals can originate from a number of sources, including drops in material wealth, being below the minimum expected Standard of Living, or supporting a movement that’s not being listened to. But one additional major cause of radicalism tends to be Discrimination - particular discrimination of literate Pops.  </p>
<p>Which begs the question, if discrimination creates radicals, and radicals lead to turmoil, and turmoil hurts your economy - why would any country discriminate against parts of their population in the first place?  </p>
<p>First, discrimination is governed by <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-7-laws.1483581/">Laws</a>, and most countries start out with Laws that would cause certain cultures or religions to be discriminated against - even if such Pops aren’t even present in the country at game starts. You don’t pick and choose which cultures or religions to discriminate against, it’s all based on your Laws and how similar other cultures and religions are to your country’s primary culture(s) and religion. These Laws are supported by <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-6-interest-groups.1481423/">Interest Groups</a>, so while you can try to put an end to your discriminatory practices by changing your Citizenship and Church &amp; State Laws, certain groups might not be pleased with you if you do.  </p>
<p>Second, discriminated Pops get paid less than their non-discriminated peers. This in turn makes ownership shareholders - and potentially all non-discriminated Pops in states where discriminated Pops live - richer, as they get a larger piece of the productivity pie. Therefore, putting an end to discrimination would hurt their personal finances, which causes <em>them</em> to Radicalize - and they have more Political Strength to hurt you with than the discriminated Pops do.  </p>
<p>Third, discriminated Pops have considerably less Political Strength than their peers. If you’re worried about potential uprisings, getting rid of discriminatory practices could certainly help you in the long-term, but in the short-term it will empower the formerly discriminated to make stronger demands. It might be tempting to retain the status quo unless you’re prepared to take the fight with both the conservative elements of your society <em>and</em> the newly equal citizens who might want to see a few changes.  </p>
<p>But since discrimination occurs on a cultural basis (and if not cultural then often religious, which often maps back to a certain cultures anyway), this means that even if Pops of a certain culture represents a small proportion of the population in your country, the proportion of Pops <em>within</em> that culture that are Radical could be very large indeed. So in addition to measuring Turmoil on the state level, we also measure it on a culture level, and on a culture-in-country level.  </p>
<p><em>The Maghrebi culture might not have very high Turmoil </em><em>overall</em><em> because most of them live in Tunis and Morocco where they aren’t discriminated against, but </em><em>within France</em><em> the Turmoil among Maghrebi Pops could reach higher levels.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2342%20-%20Cultural%20Secessions/DD42%2002.png"><img alt="DD42 02.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2342%20-%20Cultural%20Secessions/DD42%2002.png" title="DD42 02.png" /></a></p>

<p>​As we know from the Migration diary, if a whole culture has high Turmoil, this can result in the emergence of Mass Migration targets - states across the globe that temporarily gain the ability for Pops of those cultures to mass migrate there. This is the “peaceful” resolution to Discrimination - eventually, Pops who suffer systematic discrimination and see no improvement to their material conditions to compensate will simply pack up and move to someplace where they’re accepted.  </p>
<p>But if Pops in a country suffer high Turmoil <em>and live on one of their Cultural Homelands</em>, they may instead start a Secession Movement. This could be the case for the Maghrebi population of Algiers, for example: they’re not only being oppressed, but they’re being oppressed <em>on land they feel is theirs by right</em>, and the obvious solution is to kick the French out of there. However, an Algerian that moves to Nice after their homeland was colonized and introduced to the French market will not try to start a secession movement for a Maghrebian sovereign state in southern France.  </p>
<p>A Secession Movement functions a lot like a Revolutionary movement. It will gradually escalate in intensity until it reaches a threshold, after which point one or several states will break off from the country to form their own, then launch a Diplomatic Play. Much like Revolutionary and Political movements, you can deal with these by trying to fix the underlying issues - whether the discrimination or the lack of material comforts - or by suppressing the troublemakers using decrees or the Home Affairs institution. If you can get the situation back under control you can dodge the secession for this time, but the movement might of course return if conditions worsen.  </p>
<p>You can also deal with it more permanently by simply ceding the land to secessionists. In this case you would release a nation, including all Homelands of that culture in your possession. One benefit of this approach is that you can release the nation as a Subject, permitting you to still meddle in their affairs and exploit their economy even while you grant them at least some degree of self-determination. With no Homelands now left in your possession, the secessionist movement will vanish immediately.  </p>
<p><em>Another option when releasing a nation is to play as them, which immediately puts you in charge of that country instead!</em>  </p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: WIP Release California CALrum4SHEV:UL Are You sure YOu want to release California as an independent Country? will receive the following states: California Release as Independent Release as Own Subject Country California Cancel Release They Play</font></p>
<p>​But if you do not do any of these things, the secession will take place. This launches a Diplomatic Play where the country seceded from automatically gains the “Crush the Uprising” war goal, which if enforced will return the seceded states to their possession. The secessionists on the other hand only need to defend themselves! Unlike with Revolutions, a secession can (sort of by definition) result in a white peace where the seceding country is simply left to exist.  </p>
<p>Just like in Revolutionary Plays, other countries with Interests or certain Pacts are able to intervene on behalf of either country. Most importantly, if the culture seceding is already a Primary Culture in another country - for Maghrebi, that would be Tunis - that country is automatically invited to join the Play on the defender’s side. Should they succeed to beat France, the seceding states would then become part of Tunis.  </p>
<p>In addition, as soon as such a Secession Play has commenced, there is a chance that secessionist movements for this culture will break out in <em>other</em> countries, even if they <em>don’t</em> meet the Turmoil threshold! The classic example for this is Poland. Polish Pops live on Homelands across Prussia, Austria, and Russia. If any one of these countries mistreat the Poles to the point where they break away and form Poland, Polish pan-nationalist movements might break out in the other two countries as well. This potentially means having to fight all three countries for their independence!  </p>
<p><em>Will the three Great Powers unite in crushing the Polish nationalist movement? Or perhaps one will graciously give up their parcel of land to Poland and start bankrolling them instead, hoping to weaken their rivals and maybe gain a new puppet state in the process?</em>  </p>

<p>​Cultural Secession and Turmoil is a pretty classic take on anti-blobbing mechanics - if you aggressively expand too quickly your new subjects will get angry, will become more of a liability than an asset to you, and may even try to take their land back. But with Victoria’s thematic focus on nation-states and pan-nationalism, these interact with the core mechanics of Pops, Cultures, Homelands, Radicals, Turmoil, and Diplomatic Plays to give you more tools to influence the situation than just pacing your conquests. Perhaps you will be a benevolent imperialist conqueror, who abhors Discrimination and Incorporates every new state to extend the benefit of your Institutions to them, convincing the newly conquered that they’re better off under your rule? Or perhaps you will exploit their natural resources but release them as a Subject nation integrated into your market as soon as they get rowdy? Or you build good relations with a neighboring power who's also oppressing this population so you have a natural ally in case you need to put down a rebellion together? Or you stay in your own lane while putting Interests all around you, so you can get involved in these conflicts when they happen to others in order to create buffer states aligned with you?  </p>
<p>That’s all for me for a little while! Next week Ofaloaf will give us a peek at how we handle a very special butterfly of a civil war that’s not really a revolution, not really a cultural secession, but that includes elements from both: the American Civil War.</p>

<p>Point of clarification regarding subsequent uprisings by the same culture in other countries. Once these break out, they will <em>join</em> the original seceding country (or, if a country with the appropriate primary culture has already aligned with the secessionists, <em>that</em> country) such that all seceding territories of the same culture act in concert as a single nation.  </p>
<p>Each country seceded from will have a war goal to regain <em>their</em> lost states only. For example, if Poland wins against Prussia and Austria but ends up losing against Russia, they will become a sovereign nation but without the Russian part of Polish homelands, and Russia cannot capture formerly Prussian or Austrian land as part of crushing the Polish uprising. All three nations fight the same Poland in this war, not separate splinter Polands.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4ICTORIA DEV DIARY # 43 AMERICAN CIVIL WAR</font></p>
<p>​Hello folks, welcome to another dev diary for Victoria 3! This week we're going to talk about the American Civil War, a dark period in the history of the United States.   </p>
<p>Turmoil had been building under the surface of the United States for decades prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, with tension growing increasingly violent particularly in the 1850s. In 1861, several states voted to secede from the Union, and established the Confederate States of America. The Union and the Confederacy fought for four years, to 1865. After the surrender of the CSA, the Union reincorporated the states of the former Confederacy and initiated an era generally known as Reconstruction, a period of ambition, domestic unrest, and, ultimately, a failure to complete some of the most significant social reforms instigated in the wake of the CSA's defeat. The efforts and failures of Reconstruction resulted in Jim Crow laws and the promise of racial equality becoming a generations-long struggle that has carried on well past the end of the Victorian era.  </p>
<p>Let's get something established first before we dive into the game: Slavery is central to the Civil War. The authors of secession did not dance around this point. The institution of slavery was singled out time and time again <em>by the people seceding from the Union</em> in their reasons for secession, during their debates over secession, and then throughout the Civil War itself. After the war, rhetoric shifted as the Lost Cause myth developed, but before and during the war slavery was declared as a central element in the rebellion time and time again.  </p>
<p>This interpretation of history is built on solid foundations with ample evidence. Victoria 3 uses this approach as its basis for the American Civil War.  </p>
<p><em>Antebellum America's unrest is centered around slavery.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2343%20-%20The%20American%20Civil%20War/DD43%2001.png"><img alt="DD43 01.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2343%20-%20The%20American%20Civil%20War/DD43%2001.png" title="DD43 01.png" /></a></p>

Slaveholders and abolitionists are engaged in increasingly rankerous debate across the nation. Sooner or later, the arguments will stop being made with words ad start made with bullets. being</font></p>
<p>​The United States of America begins the game with a Journal Entry already underway. In the first years of the game, and historically, the 1830s were already rife with national debate over the issue of slavery, although violence was only just beginning to escalate. At this point on the national level, all the United States can try to do is balance the pressures of abolitionists and pro-slavery advocates, and either limit escalation or come down firmly on the side of one camp or another.  </p>
<p>Even a policy of appeasement and reconciliation will not stop rising tensions entirely.

<p>​The most straightforward way to end the debate over slavery may be to just <em>end</em> it, but this carries enormous risks - political movements may emerge in reaction to the potential passage of these laws. Of course, <em>not</em> banning slavery may also lead to a movement emerging explicitly agitating <em>for</em> the abolition of slavery, and that has its own set of challenges.  </p>
<p><em>Triggering the Civil War early caused a slightly different set of states to secede. Florida simply didn't have enough pro-slavery supporters here to join the pre-war movement that formed the basis of the CSA.</em>  </p>

<p>​This is where we've decided to engage with our own revolution mechanics in order to create a more dynamic American Civil War. If the Slavery Debate Journal Entry is active when a revolution over slavery erupts, the revolutionary government will turn into a secessionist government. Secession is determined by what states join the radicalized movements for preserving slavery or banning slavery, which means the strength of the secessionist government will vary depending on which IGs align themselves with the radicalized movement prior to the outbreak of revolution. If pro-slavery Interest Groups had been empowered again and again prior to their radicalization and revolution, then secessionists will control a large number of states, but if those same Interest Groups had been suppressed and their influence limited time and time again, then their government will be far smaller when war breaks out.  </p>
<p><em>Of course there's a train-centered event.</em>  </p>

<p>​The war itself has its own incidents that can complicate the pursuit of victory or give some unique opportunities. Raiders will jump back and forth across the border, causing chaos, while Unionist sympathizers in secessionist-held areas and secessionist sympathizers in Union-held areas will challenge the authority of local governments as long as the war still burns. If the secessionists are pro-slavery but the Union has not finished enacting abolition yet, the country will have a special change to radically hasten the change in law through a certain proclamation.  </p>
<p>The war itself plays out the same way  </p>
<p>If the secessionists win, then… the secessionists win, and a new country is established in North America. A Union victory, however, will lead to Reconstruction.  </p>
<p><em>Reconstruction varies depending on how the Civil War went.</em>  </p>

<p>​Reconstruction is a long and varied process. Depending on who fought, what laws were passed, and the general shape of the United States at war's end, different journal entries will spawn. Establishing the Freedmen's Bureau and pursuing the cause of equality only makes sense if you fought <em>against</em> slavery. Reconciling the South only makes sense if the South was the part of the country that rebelled. Conversely, it's possible to end up with multiple goals for Reconstruction that end up conflicting.  </p>
<p><em>Escalating violence is still a threat, even after the Civil War comes and goes.</em>  </p>

<p>​Reconstruction will be ugly. Historically, it wasn't a clean and smooth process, and in the game it's not a clean and smooth process. There was a struggle to balance the ambitions of Reconstruction against the resistance of a reactionary coalition that sought to restore their antebellum political power and impose a vision of racial supremacy upon society. Pursuing egalitarian measures will alienate these people and related groups, which may make governance more difficult and more expensive, while currying favor with them will undercut the foundations of Reconstruction and create another alienated population that will have to be contended with for the rest of the game. Every step is fraught with challenges to the government and to the welfare of the people; Reconstruction will be <em>rough</em>.  </p>

<p>Is it possible to avoid the Civil War altogether?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Since the Civil War, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is basically hijacking a revolution to create the CSA, if you can avoid a revolution you're golden. It's not guaranteed to happen, it's just that antebellum events help crank up the tension and make it all more likely to explode- but it is still avoidable.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226007">Nikolai said:</a></p>
<p>I really look forward to play the USA! Big Grin    :D Is this mechanic of changing a slavery revolt secession universal to this issue for all countries or USA only?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>American-only!   </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226019">hjarg said:</a></p>
<p>I wonder if you can do devious things, like industrialization of South, to undermine the power of slaveowners?  </p>
<p>Or will you be shooting yourself in the foot by giving South strong industrial base?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm... not actually sure. It'd depend, I suppose. A <em>bit</em> of industrialization may not be enough to sideline the slaveowners, and just give them a larger industrial base to work with. It's hard to quantify exactly how industrialized you'd need the South to be in order to completely marginalize the pro-slavery interest groups.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226028">gela1212 said:</a></p>
<p>So, to clarify: if the player consistently acts to preserve and expand slavery, the abolitionists will secede instead? Or is it a different set of problems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, secession can happen the other way around, too.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226028">gela1212 said:</a></p>
<p>Secondarily, depending on how reconstruction goes is it possible for there to be state-by-state variation in discrimination against Afro-American minorities? Or are the discrimination mechanics limited to a country-wide basis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discrimination laws are still nationwide, but modifiers from events can be applied on a state-by-state basis. Reconstruction states are marked by just getting a variable pinned on all states owned by the CSA at the start of the Civil War, so it's fairly straightforward to write events and decisions and so forth that only target states that previously belonged to the Confederacy.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226129">Jamaican Castle said:</a></p>
<p>Can you elaborate on what mechanics the Civil War shares with cultural secessions? In the previous dev diary you described it as a mixture of political revolution and secession but all of the mechanics presented here seem to belong to the former. For example, the cultural axis of Yankee vs. Dixie pops isn't touched on, and you don't say whether it's possible for the war to end in white peace (possible for secession, impossible for revolution).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's because the base for the ACW are Victoria 3's revolution mechanics, not its cultural secession ones. The CSA is likely to line up closely with Southern states, but it's not fixed to it. Secession in the game's ACW is done by basically just... aggressively going into an ongoing revolutionary diplomatic play and changing the goals, doing a bit of rewiring. I confess it's not the most elegant under the hood, but it works for taking a political debate and turning it into a secessionist fight.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226129">Jamaican Castle said:</a></p>
<p>Which brings up an interesting aside: in history, secession (and potentially the Civil War) was almost sparked by a debate over tariffs and trade law. If there's a similar flashpoint in-game and you end up having a rebellion on some other point that is important to the southern landholders (economic law, or maybe labor laws, for instance?), will the game merge that with the slavery question or leave them as separate rebel sentiments?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tariff crisis leading to secession <em>would</em> be neat, but it's not part of the ACW content- the Civil War, as its designed right now, is fixed only on the issue of slavery.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226196">Freger said:</a></p>
<p>If CSA wins what happens if they later abolish slavery? Can they rejoin the union?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the CSA secedes and then abolishes slavery, then... there's a CSA without slavery. There's no events that go "Aha, you fool! You've abolished your very <em>raison d'etre</em>! Submit to the Union <em>now!!</em>"  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226196">Freger said:</a></p>
<p>If slavery is abolished and then reinstated can the civil war happen twice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, the ACW only fires once.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226196">Freger said:</a></p>
<p>And if CSA wins, is it possible that they split up into the individual states?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We haven't created tags for every state in America, alas.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226196">Freger said:</a></p>
<p>And lastly what are the prospects of foreign intervention?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Countries can intervene in the diplomatic play under the same conditions they can intervene in any other diplomatic play.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226223">Aretii said:</a></p>
<p>Bug report: the journal entry Anti-Slavery Debate uses the word "rankerous", which should be "rancorous."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, they trust me enough to write for the game and these developer diaries, and yet I still do something like that. Thank for you the catch, I'll make sure it gets fixed.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226303">Nerdman3000 said:</a></p>
<p>Will there be a American Civil War bookmark, similar to what was in Victoria 2, for those who want to jump straight into the American Civil War?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. I understand the appeal, but I did a lot of research for pops, leaders, and database-building for the 1836 startdate, and oh my god I do not want to do that all again for 1861.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28226326">eggman69420 said:</a></p>
<p>Historically, the fact that the southern states weren't re-admitted to the Union right away was a big part of the reason Reconstruction was able to get anywhere, and the readmission is what eventually sank it, because the south was able to vote for Rutherford B Hayes. Will this readmission process be represented ingame? Seceeding states shouldn't have their political power restored as soon as the war is won, after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>States that seceded are flagged as secessionist states, as I mentioned above, and after wars end get quietly slapped with a modifier that should prevent them from being (re)incorporated as full states, until Reconstruction is concluded one way or the other.</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 44 BATTLES</font></p>
<p>Ave and welcome to another Dev Diary! Today I will be talking about how <strong>Battles</strong> work and what their consequences are. If you haven't already, I suggest you first read through the dev diary on <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/victoria-3-dev-diary-23-fronts-and-generals.1497106/">Fronts</a> and get acquainted with the concepts explained there.  </p>
<p>Let's start off with a somewhat updated version of the Front panel. <strong>Do note that this is all still very much WIP and not all values are hooked in, balanced or polished.</strong> For example at the moment there are a lot more deaths in battles than there should be.  </p>
<p><em>Who could’ve seen this war coming?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2001.png"><img alt="DD44 01.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2001.png" title="DD44 01.png" /></a></p>

<p>In order for a battle to happen one side must have at least one General with an Advance order. Once this happens an advancement meter will slowly start to fill up and once it’s full a new battle will be launched. Various factors can increase or decrease the time it takes.  </p>
<p>When the battle is created a sequence of actions unfolds before the fighting begins. All of these are in script and can be tweaked by mods as desired.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker picks their leading General</li>
<li>The defender picks their leading General</li>
<li>The battle province is determined along the frontline</li>
<li>The attacker determines the number of units they can bring</li>
<li>The defender determines the number of units they can bring</li>
<li>Both sides selects their units</li>
</ul>
<p>While there can be several Generals on the Front, only one is selected for each side in a Battle. They are not limited to selecting their own units and so may borrow additional ones from other Generals or the local Garrisons.  </p>
<p>In addition each side randomizes a <strong>Battle Condition</strong> which provides bonuses (or penalties) to their units similar to Combat Tactics in Hearts of Iron 4. Unlike HOI4 though these are fixed for the duration of the battle. For example a General with the Engineer trait has a higher chance of selecting the “Dug In” Battle Condition which provides defensive modifiers.  </p>
<p><em>Königgrätz anyone?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2002.png"><img alt="DD44 02.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2002.png" title="DD44 02.png" /></a></p>

<p>Now the shooting (and dying) finally starts! The battle takes place over a number of rounds and will continue until one side is either wiped out or retreats. The round sequence is roughly as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Each side determines how many fighting-capable men it still has</li>
<li>Each side inflicts casualties on the other side</li>
<li>Each side attempts to recover wounded casualties</li>
<li>Each side also suffers morale damage according to casualties</li>
<li>If one side is wiped or retreats, the battle ends</li>
</ul>
<p>Units have two primary combat values: <strong>Offense</strong> is used when attacking and <strong>Defense</strong> is used when defending. It is wise to plan ahead and specialize your armies for the war you are planning to fight. There are of course a whole bunch of additional modifiers used in conjunction with battles.  </p>

<p>Casualties are determined by both sheer numbers and the relative combat stats between the two sides. For example a numerically inferior force equipped with more modern weapons may still emerge victorious against a larger foe.  </p>
<p>When a side takes casualties it is randomly distributed amongst its units with some caveats.  </p>
<p>Each unit has a majority culture depending on the pops in its barracks and casualties are applied roughly in proportion to unit culture. So with 4 French/1 Flemish units fighting on the same side the French will take roughly 80% of the casualties.  </p>
<p>Not all pops who take casualties will end up dead though. A portion of these may instead end up as Dependents of other pops. After a long bloody war a nation may thus end up with a large number of wounded war-veterans who need to be supported by the rest of the population. In the long term this may be a cause of unrest and financial strain on the economy.  </p>
<p>Morale damage is inflicted in proportion to the casualties and will slowly recover over time outside of battles presuming the units are in good supply.  </p>
<p><em>One step closer to Unification</em>  </p>

<p>After the battle is over two things will happen:  </p>
<p>A number of provinces are <strong>Captured</strong> depending on how decisive the victory was, unit characteristics, Generals, etc. This will alter the frontline and the winner will occupy those provinces until retaken or the end of the war.  </p>
<p>A victorious defender will only take back land that was previously lost to the enemy while a victorious attacker will push into enemy land and take control of more provinces owing to their aggressive posture.  </p>
<p><strong>Devastation</strong> is also inflicted on the State in which the battle was fought. Large, brutal battles waged with modern weaponry will increase the devastation caused. It reduces infrastructure and building throughput, increases mortality and causes emigration. These effects persist after the war and will take quite some time to recover.  </p>
<p>That’s it for this week! Next week we switch over to the political battlefield and discuss Elections! <strong>ducks back into the trenches</strong></p>

<p><em>Who could’ve seen this war coming?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2001.png"><img alt="DD44 01.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2001.png" title="DD44 01.png" /></a></p>

<p>In order for a battle to happen one side must have at least one General with an Advance order. Once this happens an advancement meter will slowly start to fill up and once it’s full a new battle will be launched. Various factors can increase or decrease the time it takes.  </p>
<p>When the battle is created a sequence of actions unfolds before the fighting begins. All of these are in script and can be tweaked by mods as desired.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker picks their leading General</li>
<li>The defender picks their leading General</li>
<li>The battle province is determined along the frontline</li>
<li>The attacker determines the number of units they can bring</li>
<li>The defender determines the number of units they can bring</li>
<li>Both sides selects their units</li>
</ul>
<p>While there can be several Generals on the Front, only one is selected for each side in a Battle. They are not limited to selecting their own units and so may borrow additional ones from other Generals or the local Garrisons.  </p>
<p>In addition each side randomizes a <strong>Battle Condition</strong> which provides bonuses (or penalties) to their units similar to Combat Tactics in Hearts of Iron 4. Unlike HOI4 though these are fixed for the duration of the battle. For example a General with the Engineer trait has a higher chance of selecting the “Dug In” Battle Condition which provides defensive modifiers.  </p>
<p><em>Königgrätz anyone?</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2002.png"><img alt="DD44 02.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2344%20-%20Battles/DD44%2002.png" title="DD44 02.png" /></a></p>

<p>Now the shooting (and dying) finally starts! The battle takes place over a number of rounds and will continue until one side is either wiped out or retreats. The round sequence is roughly as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Each side determines how many fighting-capable men it still has</li>
<li>Each side inflicts casualties on the other side</li>
<li>Each side attempts to recover wounded casualties</li>
<li>Each side also suffers morale damage according to casualties</li>
<li>If one side is wiped or retreats, the battle ends</li>
</ul>
<p>Units have two primary combat values: <strong>Offense</strong> is used when attacking and <strong>Defense</strong> is used when defending. It is wise to plan ahead and specialize your armies for the war you are planning to fight. There are of course a whole bunch of additional modifiers used in conjunction with battles.  </p>

<p>Casualties are determined by both sheer numbers and the relative combat stats between the two sides. For example a numerically inferior force equipped with more modern weapons may still emerge victorious against a larger foe.  </p>
<p>When a side takes casualties it is randomly distributed amongst its units with some caveats.  </p>
<p>Each unit has a majority culture depending on the pops in its barracks and casualties are applied roughly in proportion to unit culture. So with 4 French/1 Flemish units fighting on the same side the French will take roughly 80% of the casualties.  </p>
<p>Not all pops who take casualties will end up dead though. A portion of these may instead end up as Dependents of other pops. After a long bloody war a nation may thus end up with a large number of wounded war-veterans who need to be supported by the rest of the population. In the long term this may be a cause of unrest and financial strain on the economy.  </p>
<p>Morale damage is inflicted in proportion to the casualties and will slowly recover over time outside of battles presuming the units are in good supply.  </p>

<p>After the battle is over two things will happen:  </p>
<p>A number of provinces are <strong>Captured</strong> depending on how decisive the victory was, unit characteristics, Generals, etc. This will alter the frontline and the winner will occupy those provinces until retaken or the end of the war.  </p>
<p>A victorious defender will only take back land that was previously lost to the enemy while a victorious attacker will push into enemy land and take control of more provinces owing to their aggressive posture.  </p>
<p><strong>Devastation</strong> is also inflicted on the State in which the battle was fought. Large, brutal battles waged with modern weaponry will increase the devastation caused. It reduces infrastructure and building throughput, increases mortality and causes emigration. These effects persist after the war and will take quite some time to recover.  </p>
<p>That’s it for this week! Next week we switch over to the political battlefield and discuss Elections! <strong>ducks back into the trenches</strong></p>

<h1><a href="self.source">Dev Diary #45 - Elections</a></h1>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/16_9.jpg"><img alt="16_9.jpg" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/16_9.jpg" title="16_9.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: 4CTORIA DEV DIARY # 45 ELECTIONS</font></p>
<p>​Good evening and welcome once again to a Victoria 3 Development Diary! Today’s topic is elections. We’ll be covering the various laws that enable and affect voting, as well as the progression of Election Campaigns and how they affect political power in your country. We'll briefly be mentioning Political Parties in this dev diary, but they’re not the focus of this week - more on that next time! For now, I’ll just say that Political Parties in Victoria 3 exist in democracies and are made up of alliances of Interest Groups.  </p>
<p>A country has Elections if it has any of the Distribution of Power laws that enable voting:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Landed Voting: Aristocrats, Capitalists, Clergymen, and Officers hold essentially all voting power, gaining a huge bonus to the Political Strength they contribute to their Interest Groups.</li>
<li>Wealth Voting: There is a Wealth Threshold that determines a pop’s eligibility to vote. Pops that can vote have more Political Strength.</li>
<li>Census Suffrage: The Wealth Threshold is significantly lower than in Wealth Voting. Literate pops contribute much more Political Strength to their Interest Groups.</li>
<li>Universal Suffrage: There is no Wealth Threshold for voting. Pop type and literacy do not grant additional Political Strength. Though of course a pop’s wealth will continue to contribute to their Political Strength, and Literacy will make pops more politically engaged.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Under the Wealth Voting Law, political power is held by the pops (and their Interest Groups) who can accumulate the most wealth, and largely denied entirely to the destitute. This naturally favors Aristocrats and the Landowners in more agricultural economies, while favoring Capitalists and the Industrialists in more industrialized economies.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/votinglaws.png"><img alt="votinglaws.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/votinglaws.png" title="votinglaws.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Wealth (Distribution of Power) Law 11.1% E Wealth Voting 3.7% Part of our Laws 85.0% +150 Authority Active +40 Political Strength from Votes +20 Wealth Threshold for Voting +20 Government Legitimacy 36.2% Unlocks Women's Suffrage (Law) in Rights of Women Census Suffrage 21.0% Requires one of the following: 42.7% Disallowed by Chiefdom (Law) in Governance Principles (Inactive) Enact (4% chance every 180 days) This Law is supported by Interest Groups Wealthy citizens are granted a vote. Men of more wealth are granted more 36.2% votes_ Universal Suffrage 21.0% Go to Details screen 42.7% WIP Enact (4% chance every 180 days) Voting Law</font></p>
<p>​All of these laws are compatible with any of the Governance Principles laws. A country with the Monarchy law for instance could be an absolute monarchy with no voting system at all, or it could have Universal Suffrage - likewise a Republic might very well be a presidential dictatorship. If you are so inclined, you could even create a Council Republic or Theocracy that uses Wealth Voting (though it would be bound to create some political conflict, to put it lightly).  </p>
<p>There are three factors that, when applicable, will prevent pops from voting entirely:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Discrimination. Discriminated pops cannot vote in Elections.</li>
<li>Living in an Unincorporated State. Only pops living in Incorporated States can participate in Elections. Pops living in, for example, a growing colony cannot vote.</li>
<li>Politically Inactive pops do not vote, regardless of whether they are “legally” eligible. These pops are not part of any Interest Group, and tend to have low Literacy and/or Standard of Living. Peasants working in Subsistence Farms, for instance, are almost always Politically Inactive.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>In 1913, suffragette Emily Davison was killed by the king’s horse during a race. A passionate believer in her cause, she had been arrested repeatedly by the British government and force-fed while on hunger strikes.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/suffrage.png"><img alt="suffrage.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/suffrage.png" title="suffrage.png" /></a></p>

We won't extend political sympathy to such reckless behavio1 DEBUG: Open Event in text editor DEBUG: Trigger description Event ID: suffragist_events.4 1</font></p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to talk about the women’s suffrage movement. In Victoria 3, passing the Women’s Suffrage Law will greatly increase both your Workforce Ratio and your Dependent Enfranchisement. This means that a greater proportion of pops will be eligible to work in Buildings, and a much greater proportion of Dependents will now count towards the voting power of their pop. There will be very little support among Interest Groups to pass this Law in 1836 however. After researching Feminism (or having the technology spread to your country), politicians will begin to appear with the Feminist ideology, which causes them to strongly approve of Women’s Suffrage and disapprove of less egalitarian laws. Once you research Political Agitation, the suffrage movement will begin in full force. The ‘Votes for Women’ Journal Entry will appear, and events will trigger from it that will give you the opportunity to grow or suppress the Political Movement. You can complete the Journal Entry by passing the Law and having your first Election Campaign with women eligible to vote; alternatively you can ignore or suppress the movement until it loses its momentum and withers away.   </p>
<p>Why, you ask, would you want to suppress the suffrage movement? If you’re striving for an egalitarian society you certainly wouldn’t. But if instead you’re trying to preserve the aristocracy and maintain a conservative nation then not only will your ruling Interest Groups strongly disapprove of Women’s Suffrage but it will also be very harmful to their political power. Greater Dependent Enfranchisement inherently benefits larger pops more than smaller pops (especially under more egalitarian Laws like Universal Suffrage where wealth counts for less), and it is inevitable that there are vastly more Laborers, Machinists, and Farmers than there ever will be Aristocrats or Capitalists. Pops may begin to wonder why the Lower Strata, the largest class, does not simply eat the other two.  </p>
<p><em>The Whigs took a catastrophic hit in the polls after I repeatedly fired a negative election event to test the system.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/electioncampaign.png"><img alt="electioncampaign.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/electioncampaign.png" title="electioncampaign.png" /></a></p>

<p>​Elections happen every 4 years in countries with voting laws. An Election Campaign begins 6 months prior to a country’s Election date. Each Political Party is assigned a Momentum value at the beginning of the Campaign, which is a measure of the success of their campaign and is a major factor in determining how many Votes they will garner on election day. During this campaign, Momentum will fluctuate for each of the running Political Parties and impact the final result. Since Parties, Leaders, and many other aspects of the political scene in your country are likely to have changed in the years since the previous election, the Momentum from previous elections does not carry over and is reset. Momentum can be affected by chance, events, and the Popularity of Interest Group Leaders.  </p>
<p><em>The Tories’ success in the last election empowered the Landed Gentry, though the sheer wealth of their aristocratic supporters is still the largest contributor to their Political Strength under Great Britain’s Wealth Voting law.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="images/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/electionvotespower.png"><img alt="electionvotespower.png" src="thumbs/Dev%20Diary%20%2345%20-%20Elections/electionvotespower.png" title="electionvotespower.png" /></a></p>

<p>​When the Election Campaign ends, the votes are in and the results are set in place until the next election. Interest Groups receive additional Political Strength from their party’s Votes, which will be a major factor determining your Legitimacy and therefore the effectiveness of your government. The actual makeup of your government is still up to you; just like the electoral systems of most modern countries, winning the popular vote does not automatically mean that a certain party or coalition of parties gets to form a government. But the post-election strength of your Interest Groups and their Party affiliations should be a major consideration, especially if you’re forming a minority government.  </p>
<p>In Victoria 3, Elections can be a powerful force for political change but also a source of volatility. Dealing with (and if you’re so inclined, manipulating) Election results will be a major consideration when you form your governments. In this dev diary I’ve mentioned Political Parties, and we know you’re eager to hear more about them since the last time we communicated on the topic. You’ll be pleased to discover that in next week’s dev diary we’ll be covering our design for Political Parties in more detail, so watch this space!</p>

<p>Which is probably a good time to ask if election events solely change Momentum or can have other impacts (like IG satisfaction). What type of events are there? Can Momentum related events backfire, like say <em>attempted</em> rigging be uncovered?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Election events almost always have effects other than Momentum changes.  </p>

<p>How does the women’s suffrage movement work in absolute monarchies like Japan? Will I be able to still enact it, to have Female Empresses beside just Emporer and also get woman in the workforce, while still not allowing any voting whatsoever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Women's Suffrage can only be enacted in countries with Elections.  </p>

<p>Where does the notion that peasants don't vote from from? Especially if you have universal suffrage?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peasants are <em>usually</em> Politically Inactive due to their low wealth and literacy. Wealthier and more educated peasants might very well develop some political consciousness and start supporting the Rural Folk though.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=28252112">lachek reqplied to Dev Diary #45 - Elections</a></h4>
<p>The reason an election doesn't simply cause "the winning" party to take power is because, outside of two-party states, we need to give the player a chance to build a ruling coalition. Say an election split the vote 50/30/20 between the Conservative, Free Trade, and Religious parties. I might not want the Conservatives in charge at all, and decide the Free Trade + Religious parties result in sufficient Legitimacy to get by - or I could sideline the Free Trade party entirely by putting the Conservative and Religious parties in charge. This is hardly even "gamey", these kinds of post-election negotiations that set the terms for what might be politically feasible during the upcoming mandate period are virtually the norm in almost all democratic countries. We also permit free Interest Groups unaligned with any party to support a ruling party, if for example the Armed Forces have decided to stand outside party politics entirely but still have considerable Wealth-derived Political Strength due to consisting mostly of Aristocrats and well-paid Officers and supported by high-ranking Generals. So player input into which coalition should form (and support) the government is necessary.  </p>
<p>Normally, when kicking an Interest Group (or a Party, along with all its Interest Groups) out of government, it gains a bunch of Radicals who are displeased with being removed from power. Just after an election, this penalty is revoked for a single reformation of the player's government, incentivizing using this opportunity to optimize Legitimacy in light of these new election results.  </p>
<p>On the subject of the fine details of electoral systems (length of mandate periods, proportional vs first-past-the-post, upper and lower houses, etc.) these details are very interesting and we've played with laws that govern some of this in the past. The problem was that they were hard to balance so they mattered as much as the other laws, and they did not feel impactful to enact. Not implying here that the details of electoral systems are unimportant - I've certainly had my share of lengthy debates of the impact of MMP vs FPTP - but in the simulation the impact isn't felt as tangibly and doesn't affect gameplay as much as, say, extending the voting franchise to more Pops or instituting a welfare program. So to do this justice we'd probably need a system of sub-laws or configurable laws, which isn't something we'll be able to do for release at least.</p>

<p>Is this hardcoded?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtually nothing is hardcoded, the term limit is just a define / parameter in the game files you can change if you want it longer or shorter. Making it variable based on decisions taken in-game isn't currently supported but should be very easy to do, for mod support at the very least. I'll put it on the todo-list. Smile    :)</p>

<p>Ah, the tech industry and its TLA's (Three Letter Acronyms) Big Grin    :D PDT at Paradox stands for "Personal Development Time", which in practice means a day per month we can work on a pet project - for our own game, another team's game, tools to make our lives easier, a personal prototype, or whatever.

<p>So this particular feature really didn't take away from any planned development, nor will it impact QA resources in any meaningful way. Monuments with their unique effects are cool (imo) but they don't impact the game balance to such an extent that we need to do continuous regression testing with different Game Rule permutations.</p>

<p>My GDP did not grow to inflation per say - its more that I am speculating heavily in industries as the first producer - steel and locomotives. Knowing this I am saying my current evaluation is inflated higher than it should be.  </p>
<p>Because of this I am reaping the rewards of being the first main producer: high prices in a market that wants these goods but once the AI starts upping its production as well, my profits will diminish and the bubble will burst... unless I move on to the next industrial good before that.  </p>
<p>I have been able to get away with this for longer that usual becauase turmoil at home in Germany and across the world is making it where the AI is having trouble establishing more complex industries.  </p>
<p>My GDP is based on the value of the goods I am producing, so I know the value of my goods are inflated due to such and would expect that GDP will not grow as quickly in the future because all growth will be offset by the decrease in these values as the AI catches up.</p>

<p>Its just an attempt to keep terms clearer in understanding - inflation is a term that is known to be in discussion of monetary policy and the valueation of money comparatively to itself over time. It is generally a term that is utilized to describe the movement of a group of goods, not a singular one.  </p>
<p>While if a goods price is high due to having more demand than supply, it is certainly "inflated" but that is not "inflation" it may seem pedantic but its ultimately just there to try and avoid confusion, so we don't get comments that are thinking its because we are utilizing monetary levels of policy when in fact its fiscal - ie the actual purchasing of goods and services, not the adjustment of the money supply.</p>

<p>Purchasing Power Parity would also not be the best statistic to utilizefor GDP measurement because its not meant to measure GDP, its meant to measure relative standard of living due to national labor markets and exchange rate manipulation by governments.  </p>
<p>Its trying to clear the confusion of our modern world with multiple national currencies and say what the exchange rate means to the consumer. This statistic would be irrelvant to be put in V3 at the moment because we do not have any significant monetary policy levers and it is also (partially) abstracted in our standard of living statistics for each nation.  </p>
<p>Standard of living for V3 is basically saying - for this countries GDP - this is what it means for the economic classes, which while not a 1:1 to PPP its a reasonable historical variant.</p>

<p>It is true that people tend to link inflation only with monetary policy so I understand that you want to make it clear that there’s no monetary policy in the game.

<p>Yes, it would qualify as "supply-shock" or "cost-push" inflation if you felt that using the word inflation was needed. Normally to avoid confusion I just say "increase in prices" as its when you see the relative increase in prices in one or multiple goods eat away at a standard of living. Its not normally known in most parlence as inflation - that one goes to money supply based inflation.  </p>

<p>Please before you start an "actually" comment read the previous comments where I explain that inflation can be both monetary and fiscal (as in supply shocks) but due to the number of conversations where we have talked about inflation solely in terms of monetary policy and the predominance of understanding inflation in that terms that I like to make it clearer when I draw the distinction.  </p>

<p>I see, I thought that ppp had also into account the differences in local prices. For instance let’s say that we have country A and country B. In country A a car cost 20k and in country B 25k, both in the same currency. If country A produces 2 M cars and country B 1.7M cars, the GDP due to car production will be 40000M for country A and 42500M for country B. But a car is a car and country B produces less cars, should it have more GDP due to cars?  </p>
<p>This makes me think. The day has come and I’m playing Vic 3. I am producing 100k furnitures that are sold at 100 each amounting to a “furniture” GDP of 10M My industries can be profitable with a lower price and I could import more furniture to improve SOL. So I import it and prices reduce to 80. Now my GDP is reduced by 2M even if my pops are richer. Is that correct? It feels a bit strange to me.  </p>
<p>In any case thank for your replies. I’m probably not alone if I say that this responses by devs are highly appreciated, specially in Saturday. Thank you very much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like you are attempting to be a bit too reductive in this example and look at this statically, when there are a few dynamics thatwould result that can make the change.  </p>
<p>While your lowered prices of goods would mean that the standard of living of your pops would go up - there is no guarantee it would stay up. As you have lowered the selling price of your domestic factories (in this scenario) and they may adjust wages of your domestic market relative to this, which will as a result mean they have a lower purchasing power and see their standard of living drop despite prices having dropped (it is entirely dependent upon the relative elasticity of their consumption basket of goods relative to the elasticity of the goods produced that supply their income).  </p>
<p>This is the problem with single industry examples, your workforce is locked into this industry here and thus the attempts to create clarity create unknowns.  </p>
<p>If you could import furniture at a lower cost than you can domestically produce it, your standard of living would go up assuming you could move that part of your labor force that is out of the job into profitable industires equal or or greater than the furniture factories. This is the zero-sumness of trade with comparative advantage. It can sometimes be hard to wrap one's head around because it necessitates a lot of moving parts but it also assumes things like the flexibility of our economy.  </p>
<p>If you could not move your labor force after importing cheaper furniture, your SOL would quickly start dropping to reflect your lesser GDP.</p>

<p>I keep seeing people post this on the forums, but I've never been able to find a post where the developers actually say this. Do you have a link to a developer stating this? Because I don't think Wiz was playing on some sort of faster build. It was even asked in the AAR why he was able to do everything so fast, and Wiz stated something along the lines that everything happens faster than expected in Vicky 3 due to the four ticks per day. If he was playing on a special build where everything was made quicker, then this would have been the perfect time for him to state this, but he did not. So this is just my opinion, based on hardly any evidence, but I think the AARs have been played on a build without anything sped up, and then fans are making up the "faster build" to explain why everything is so quick and easy to do. We all might be quite surprised when the game releases if this is just misinformation everyone is spreading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a thing. It's not that we have a special speeded up build, it's that we've avoided doing too much balancing on pacing because faster pacing makes it easier to test and develop features up until late in development.</p>

<p>Yep, just that the economic focus would be strengthening the agrarian/resource economy rather than liberalizing. So try to revive the Ottoman Empire without making too many fundamental changes to its social structure, basically.</p>

<p>There really isn't a contradiction here. Playing as the 'spirit of the nation' doesn't mean that the player necessarily should have, or should not have control of any one specific aspect of their country. All it means is that we are not designing the game with the idea that the player is any one specific actor or group of actors within the nation and thus should be restricted to what they would be able to control. What we let the player control and not control is thus entirely governed by what we feel best fits the game's design and makes for the best (in our view) overall gameplay. The reason you can't directly control your armies has nothing to do with playing as the spirit of the nation and everything to do with our design goals for the military system.</p>

<p>Revols or Secessions are different now as they trigger a special kind of Diplomatic Play, allowing an international response on either side.

<p>It depends for some it would be fun as we can see, but for some it definitely wouldn't. For me it would ruin big part of fun. I for example want to play Ottoman Empire and have a powerful russia as adversary - russia it was, with powerful army, oppressing minorities. Russia with polish puppet would be immersion breaking - not historical, weaker than really was, etc.  </p>
<p>If someone really wishes to play Poland, why not release puppet as russia?  </p>
<p>Let's add another argument here which I saw in someone's comment somewhere else: if Poland - historically at that time just a region with some autonomy - can be a puppet, then a puppet is not the proper thing for for example Tunis - a state with ruler, army, subject of Ottoman sultan. Then Tunis should be a protectorate - but then Serbia, a state with higher autonomy than Tunis, should be a yet different type of subject that currently doesn't exist.  </p>
<p>Making Poland playable at the game start would require a special new type of subject that is basically incapable of doing anything. I don't see point in that.  </p>
<p>Comparison to Finland, even if it made sense, is problematic in context of other states that are puppets in game, such as Tunis, which had far far far more autonomy than Poland die to reasons described above.</p>

<p>Tunis is a Protectorate - the most independent type of subject. I think they were incorrectly set as a Puppet at some point previously though.</p>

<p>YESTERDAY, January 12 2022, a date which will live in infamy, pie charts were suddenly and deliberately removed by programmers and UX designers of Paradox.  </p>
<p>The pie chart interest group was at peace with that company and, at the solicitation of Paradox, was still in conversation with its lead developers looking toward the maintenance of pie charts in the UI. Indeed, one hour after Paradox UX designers had commenced disparaging pie charts in the developer diary, the Paradox Community Ambassador and his colleague delivered to our interest group leader Darkath a formal reply to a recent pie chart demonstration of superiority. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of removal or of being downgraded to a secondary option.  </p>
<p>It will be recorded that the distance of internet wires from Sweden makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Paradox development team has deliberately sought to deceive the pie charts interest group by false statements and expressions of hope for continued primacy in the UI.  </p>
<p>The attack yesterday on pie charts has caused severe damage to our interest group’s intention to buy the game. I regret to tell you that very many pie charts supporters have been lost. In addition pie charts supporters have been reported disparaged on the forums by a hitherto unknown fifth column of treemapping supporters.  </p>
<p>Paradox has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the UI. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The pie charts interest group has already formed its opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our charts.  </p>
<p>As Commander in Chief of pie charts, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.  </p>
<p>But always will our whole Pie remember the character of the onslaught against us.  </p>
<p>No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated removal from the UI, pie charts in their righteous might will win through to absolute supremacy.  </p>
<p>I believe that I interpret the will of the interest group when I assert that we will not only defend pie charts to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.  </p>
<p>Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our charts, our way of conveying information, and our graphical distinctiveness are in grave danger.  </p>
<p>With confidence in our charts with the unbounding determination of easily read information they convey, we will gain the inevitable triumph so help us Pie.  </p>
<p>I ask that the assembled members of our interest group declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly sneak attack by Paradox on Wednesday, January 12, 2022, a state of war has existed between pie charts and Paradox</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WE, by the grace of Johan, Kaiser of Sweden, seated on the throne occupied by the same dynasty from time immemorial, enjoin upon ye, Our loyal and brave fans:  </p>
<p>We hereby declare War on pie charts. The programmers and UX designers of Our Team shall do their utmost in prosecuting the war.

<p>Yeah, this is on the todolist to revise.

<p>One thing that should be noted is that Pops in subsistence counts very little for GDP, less than they should if we were trying to be strictly realistic.

<p>The GDP data shouldn't be treated as gospel or that the game is broken if countries don't match the data either directly or relatively, but it <strong><em>is</em></strong> a useful indicator of relative level of development at the start of the game, so we're certainly not going to ignore it entirely either. I think this thread made some fair points (and it was already on my todolist to buff Spain and probably also Austria a bit) backed by data. As with everything we use as a source and reference when building our games, we use the source material in our decision-making but ultimately, we're making a game and the most important part of the history setup is the historical plausibility of the <em>outcomes</em>, not that the numbers align absolutely perfectly. However, if we can make those numbers a bit more historical (as best we can get it with the sources available) without the result being outweighted by less believable outcomes, I see no reason not to do so.</p>

<p>By this point, the title of Caliph had sort of lost most of its meaning and become more of a prestige title claimed by a whole bunch of different states to try and gain religious legitimacy, so I really don't think having it as a tag makes too much sense in the 19th century.

<p>Beer is currently consolidated into the broader Liquor good.

<p>I mean, that's precisely the kind of meaningful production difference I'm talking about, where producing liquor is sugar-intensive while beer is grain-intensive (in this case grain would take the role of hops, unless we want to add hops as a good but that seems a little too hyper-specific). That's of course something of a simplification of reality (not all liquor is produced the same way after all), but reflective enough of reality that I'd consider implementing it. That doesn't mean I'm promising a beer good for release, but I'll actively consider it now.</p>

<p>It really depends on the context here, here's how I would want it to play out:  </p>
<p>Can a Mexico that has secured strong allies like Great Britain defeat the US? Sure, that's doable, though they probably shouldn't want to back any Mexican attempts to annex the US core states.  </p>
<p>Can Mexico beat back the US in the early game? Shouldn't be impossible, though the US is stronger on the defense than the offense, so conquering them should be a lot harder.  </p>
<p>Can a mid-game Mexico with no allies, little industrial development and a relatively backwards army defeat a historical US with a larger, more advanced army? Probably not, <em>maybe</em> if they have an absolutely brilliant general and the US has terrible commanders.  </p>
<p>Can an industrialized Mexico that has kept up with the times and built up its military go defeat the US alone? Possibly, if the US hasn't built up its army enough or Mexico's economy has caught up that of the US (perhaps through becoming the #1 migrant magnet in the new world) over the course of the decades.</p>

<p>Yeah, I knew that could happen in a war but the devs have always made it sound like a diplo play has to end in war or backing down, which would be strange. Hopefully they can it's covered when peace settlements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Diplomatic Play is not to be thought of as a negotiation between two sides to come to a mutually satisfactory resolution. It is best thought of as a <strong>demand and implied threat</strong> by one side, which they at least pretend is totally legitimate - much like a Casus Belli / War Justification.  </p>
<p>The other side can add demands of their own, again not to negotiate an agreement, but to up the stakes. The Diplomatic Play can only escalate, never de-escalate, much like how in poker nobody can take their ante back if they also agree another player may return theirs.  </p>
<p>So no, a Diplomatic Play cannot end in a negotiated agreement where both sides walk away having won some/lost some. Either one side submit to the other's demand, or this chest-puffing leads to an actual conflict with both greater risks and greater rewards. That conflict can end in a compromise agreement, but that's because all pretense that the claimant was fully justified in their demands is now gone and participants are bargaining with their lives.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. Follow up question - can to powers negotiate for things they can get through war without having to go to war to get it? For example, if I want province X can I pay the nation that owns that province for it? Of offer them market access and favorable trade deals? Or offer territory in exchange?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sorts of transactional tit-for-tat deals are not part of our diplomatic system repertoire, no. Certain effects (e.g. I'll trade you 10% of my income for 10% of your Influence, or whatever) could theoretically be modeled using bilateral Pacts and one might argue that e.g. Subject pacts are all about trading autonomy for protection and economic benefits. But freeform diplomatic negotiations that you might see in Stellaris or Civ, where you put some stuff of yours in a bucket and asks for a similarly-valued bucket of stuff in return, is not modeled for a couple of reasons: 1, it's very gamey and often pretty unrealistic in practice (100 barrels of oil per week plus a suitcase with £645k in unmarked bills in exchange for a research pact and the entire state of Loire seems to have equal value, sign on the dotted line please!) and 2, it's very difficult to balance to make it worth your while while not also being extremely exploitable.</p>

<p>I really don't understand why the devs consider pausing/speed 5 is a problem to be solved though...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because if we designed the game around the premise that if people are bored they can always turn to speed 5, or if people are overwhelmed they can always pause, this has two major and intertwined detrimental effects on the game:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the game's pacing is a very different experience in large countries compared to small countries, where even with full speed controls players of smaller countries might feel like they have too little agency while larger countries can be outright tedious to manage  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asymmetric multiplayer (e.g. where one player is a large country and at war, while another player is a small country at peace) becomes either overwhelming for the first player or boring for the second  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, when a player changes their game speed this should ideally be a subjective decision based on personal playstyle, not a way to "skip the boring parts" or "pull the emergency brake". Ideally there should be no boring parts, and the game should never overwhelm you with so many decisions in such a short amount of time that you have to stop the train in its tracks to take a breath.  </p>
<p><em>Ideally</em>, that is. Of course we're not going to remove this functionality, because there are extenuating circumstances or just personal preference. Pause/FF gameplay is fine and it's your option if you want to play that way. We're just not going to <em>force</em> you to do that by designing the game so you <em>have</em> to.</p>

<p>It looks like unit prices are measured in pounds in Vicky. This raises a question that is even more interesting if my impression is wrong. Note: I am not well schooled in economics, please be generous in your responses.  </p>
<p>An arch simulationist would propose a model that included multiple currencies, with exchange rates, and other arcane horrors. Goods in a province would be priced in the local currency. Intercurrency trade would take exchange rate into account. National policies around local currency could be set, if the nation controls the currency.  </p>
<p>The implementation of multiple currencies would likely be expensive in computation and AI and potential runaway exploits (some exploitation would be the point and resulting tension would be the point Smile    :) ).  </p>
<p>In your opinion would the addition of multiple currency domains be valuable ("fun" being loaded)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking from the perspective of a player, where I think multiple currencies would be fun is:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>deciding to become a sovereign issuer so I can control my own monetary policy vs. deciding to adopt someone else's in exchange for simplicity and stability  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deciding if/when to switch my currency from being backed by precious metals (hard money) to governmental assurances (fiat money)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modeling falling or rising trust in a fiat currency and the hyperinflation or stagflation that can result  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>benefiting from my currency being dominant in local or global international trade  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getting to name my currency and seeing the use of my own currency symbol in the UI  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of a developer, having to <em>actually</em> deal with hundreds of currencies whose values float freely against each other and who each have unique market- and local prices for all 50+ goods would not be worth any of those things. I think it's probably possible to create <em>some</em> of the gameplay dynamics above through some level of abstraction though. Hopefully we'll be able to take a crack at it in the future, because it's genuinely something I'd love to see in play!</p>

<p>As a non-developer forgive the stupid question but... is there any technological solution currently available to eventually hitting this kind of near-real world system? GPU-run calculations? Cloud server offloading?  </p>
<p>Because honestly once you're in a fiat currency scenario, I could also see all sorts of financial levers being fun for players to play with. Ok, "fun" may only apply to a small subset of economics geeks, but it would be great to have the opportunity to adjust money supply, devalue your currency to make exports more attractive, and trying to expand your monetary union (EU style). I'm excited to play with the system we'll have for Vic3, but wondering what kind of enhancements we might see in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the main problems as I see it (note that I'm not a programmer by trade beyond what I need to know as a systems designer, so take this with a grain of salt) is actually not processing power as such, but rather player responsiveness, code complexity, and data size.  </p>
<p>Heavy calculations can usually be dealt with using caching techniques and load distribution across multiple threads, frames, even ticks in some cases. But large datasets (like what you might get by introducing a hundred-fold increase in the basic unit of the economic system) means larger game states / save files, and this can impact performance exponentially. To reduce data size it's necessary to invent domain-specific ways to represent the data more optimally, which increases code complexity. Increased complexity in a highly interconnected game means a high risk of difficult to detect bugs. And all of these clever solutions must be transparent to a player: any change to the game state imposed by a human must have immediate effects in the UI, or the game starts feeling laggy and confusing.  </p>
<p>Modern graphics cards overcome some of these limitations by having large amounts of extremely high-bandwidth RAM available to the GPU, which offers domain-specific ways to efficiently compute solutions to the precise problems it's designed to solve. Today this includes physics as well as graphics problems. So what we really need is to convince Nvidia and AMD to include econ-sim operations and a dedicated API to the next generation GPUs! Big Grin    :D Until then I imagine more RAM on higher-bandwidth buses will help a bit, and more cores of course.  </p>
<p>But the biggest gains are always found in better design- and software engineering solutions.</p>

<p>This is something are actively discussing a lot. The problem with allowing demobilization is that it takes a lot of what's interesting about mobilization (the fact that you're committing to certain expenses and losses) and risks turning it into 'oh yeah, just mobilize everyone and demobilize if you don't need them' but it is admittedly potentially awkward to be stuck with a fully mobilized 1 million man army because you need to wait for the naval invasion of Cuba to complete, so we'll need to find a good middle way approach between these two problems.</p>

<p>With the caveat that it of course depends on the war - if a player Luxemburg with 5000 soldiers tries to stand alone against the German Empire with hundreds of thousands of soldiers on its border, fails to secure any help from other countries and still refuses to back down in the Diplomatic Play, there isn't really any realistic path to victory for them. But that's an extreme example and most wars shouldn't be like that, especially since backing down in Diplomatic Plays exist as a way to diplomatically resolve completely lopsided conflicts. The example I was replying to was the Carlist rebellion, where I definitely don't think it should just be predetermined that the Carlists lose.</p>

<p>I don't see us doing this for Victoria, for both gameplay, UX and debuggability reasons. That being said, what we are doing in some places is to label different numbers with a descriptive name in order to make things more flavourful and easier to grasp. For instance, a Standard of Living of 1 is labeled as "Starving (1)" and Dye with the Market Price of £60.0 is labeled as "Market Price: £60.0 (Very Expensive)". The numbers could easily be modded away.</p>

<p>Something that's worth noting which I don't think I made clear enough in the Relations/Infamy dev diary is that countries aren't going to react uniformly to another country's Infamy - whether or not they will be concerned depends on whether that country is a credible threat to their interests. For example, a Sokoto that hasn't somehow established an Interest somewhere in South America isn't going to be bothered no matter how much infamy a landlocked Paraguay piles on.</p>

<p>On who supports who, AI logic in who to support is fairly primitive in current build and it's important to note that the AI is far from always going to take a side just because they can - even a country with a preference for a side is usually going to want a concrete reason to take up arms, especially if supporting the aggressor.</p>

<p>I'm interested to know if paradox will actually try to make multiplayer viable, or if it will be an afterthought like in eu4?  </p>
<p>Will there still be pop up events that DEMAND the player's immediate attention? I think the event system is bad overall, but it's especially bad in a real-time, no-pausing, in-the-middle-of-a-war multiplayer setting. Some events require some thought about which alternative to choose, some events are just unimportant spam events, and all events immediately remove players' control of e.g. armies and demand a response of some kind. This is fine for singleplayer, but you simply CANNOT HAVE THIS in a multiplayer game. It is hard to come up with worse game design than this. Ideally, get rid of the spam events, even for singleplayer, and implement some kind of event-queue that the player can check when they have free time.</p>

<p>Events will behave somewhat differently from the old PDS formula, stay tuned for the DD Smile    :)   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you make it possible to wage a multifront war without the main obstacle being that players are LITERALLY UNABLE to focus on several fronts at once? <strong>Fighting a multifront war against players in eu4, even if you by numbers outmatch them combined, is impossible. In a game about global empires, it must be possible to actually play as one effectively, and not constantly lose wars against inferior enemies solely because they out-micro you</strong>. There must be ways to delegate more to the AI. Eu4 fleet missions and vassal interactions is a good start, but this system must be improved.</p>

<p>I would argue this is one of the reasons why MP is exciting! Big Grin    :D  </p>

<p>Yes, these are work in progress numbers, we want to try to tighten these up a bit before release to increase the range of impact possible. At this point in development it's generally good to not set these too aggressively though - the economic engine underpins everything and the more extreme it can become the more severe the impact on the rest of the game. My plan is to tune these to be as harsh as possible without breaking the game. The impact of even small changes is greater than one would expect, since building expenses and revenues are both based on goods and the wages they're able to pay affect the Pop consumption and thereby demand for goods and thereby goods prices, etc etc.</p>

<p>Doing like 20 backflips in a row involuntarily from the sheer joy of looking at a bunch of images of maps  </p>
<p>Edit: Wait, hold on, obligatory complaint about a map detail I don't like, it seems like British Columbia and Oregon Territory are split away into their own nation which I assume is maybe the Columbia Department, owned by the North West Company. The only issue is that the North West Company and the Husdons Bay Company (which I assume is the big blob taking up most of central Canada) were merged by the British Government in 1821, so by the start date they should be one big blob.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, this is something I can speak on! Hi, I do content design stuff for the game.  </p>
<p>So, while the Columbia District was properly part of the Hudson Bay Company by the start of the game period, it did enjoy a modest amount of autonomy, and also was subject to a condominium with the United States, and we didn't want to <em>totally</em> ignore the joint occupancy agreed to under the Treaty of 1818. With these considerations in mind, we felt it best to represent the region as its own tag rather than an integrated part of the Hudson Bay Company.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27731448">Wizzington commented on Anyone else discouraged by the heavy economy focus?</a></h4>
<p>The main pillars of the game are economy, politics and (to a slightly lesser degree) diplomacy. It may feel like economy is disproportionally important compared to the other two right now, but I think that's more down to the fact that we've just had more dev diaries about it than anything. There will be plenty of dev diaries coming on politics, diplomacy and even war in the future. With that said, Victoria 3 for sure is and should be a game with a heavy focus on economics, and that is not going to change.</p>

<p>You can either join another market to access its goods or maintain your own and import what you lack, assuming you can afford the infrastructure required to do so.  </p>
<p>Equador in the game right now (subject to change ofc) has wood/iron/coal albeit not in great quantities plus a useful variety of agricultural options. I think the main challenge would be improving literacy to properly industrialize and reforming your laws and institutions.  </p>
<p>I find Denmark an interesting challenge. You have a modern state with an educated populace but very few raw resources, more so than Sweden.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27736860">hagerhink commented on Please stick to one timeframe (weekly/monthly/yearl) in tool-tips and infoboxes</a></h4>
<p>You are correct that this is confusing. Most of the numbers in game, especially the ones related to the economy, are based on the weekly tick. Some of the places pointed out in this thread has now been clarified (like the Production Method tooltip). The annual numbers on the Building screen are in part a remnant from early development when the numbers were much smaller (most Pops generally made something like £0.001 weekly), so showing that annually was a necessity to be able to differentiate between the different Pop Types. It also ties in to some other screens, which means that removing/reworking that might be slightly bigger task, so fixing that will be a matter of priority.</p>

Countries near or likely to be near each other need to having distinct enough colors to be able to tell apart immediately at a glance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the amount of countries we have compared to the colors actually available, this is much more of a tall order than you might think, especially for a country with a global presence like Portugal that is 'near' dozens of other countries. We also don't want to just completely ignore national colors associated with certain countries when assigning map colors.</p>

<p>Which countries start in or out of the Zollverein (Prussian-led Customs Union) should be based on which countries had membership in 1836, as close as we can get it anyway (I believe for instance Frankfurt joined only on 2nd January of 1836 but close enough).</p>

<p>It isn't easy. I was thinking intelligentsia for the 17.5% (anti-autocracy/pro-census suffrage), but then why would they favor landed/wealth?

<p>Thanks for your feedback! When it comes to white-space, at this point of time in the development process I’d rather err on the side of having ”too much” rather than ”too little”. Especially given how much time the rest of the design team spends iterating on functionality and adding more complexity to the game. Making things tighter is always going to be much easier than cramming things in. All of the UIs are also very much WIP, and will be continuously polished as we get closer to release!</p>

<p>At the moment we do not have any special mechanics for The German Confederation. I wouldn't say it's out of the question that we might have special content or some mechanics relating to it on release, but it is one of those areas where we have to make choices about what we do and do not have time for on release, and as much as the German Confederation (and the preceding HRE) are among my favorite historical entities (what can I say, I like silly German pseudo-state formations...) I don't think it would be justified to take too much time away from the core mechanics of the game for a niche system like this. It's for sure something I'd want to have in the game at some point, though.</p>

<p>One way that our system does support this is that it isn't like 100% of the aristocracy is in the Landowners group, and the logic for which pops tend to join what are fully scriptable so that specific circumstances in your country can increase or decrease the tendency for individuals within a Pop to join a specific IG. For example, the Trade Unions start out with very weak attraction across the board but grow stronger from the spread of ideas like Egalitarianism and Socialism.</p>

<p>The Devout are actually in favor of religious schools that increase literacy, it's just that they want to control that education as much as possible, and the Intelligentsia do prefer religious schools to no schools at all, so it's possible for them to work together if they have a shared goal.</p>

<p>There will be a dev diary about this coming in the not too distant future! What I can say for now is that we want the political simulation to work in all forms of societies, even ones where political parties wouldn't really be a thing due to for example being an autocracy without any form of formal political system. I can also say that political ideologies (liberalism, socialism etc) are for sure a huge thing in the game's political system.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27643115">lachek commented on A Small Comment on Labour Elasticities and Income Shares of Different Factors in Victoria 3</a></h4>
<p>First off, great post. Love the analysis of game mechanics implications in real-life terms. The analysis is correct in many ways, particularly in how every perturbation demand adjustments toward a stable equilibrium (between multiple agents, at that) - this needs to happen at a rate fast enough to make effective corrections without the economy crashing but not so fast as to cause ping-pong effects. This is something we're tweaking pretty frequently to make sure effects are tangible and understandable without being disastrous.  </p>
<p>One piece of the puzzle you might be missing is that employers are also considered part of the building's workforce, and draw a wage from it in addition to collecting the dividends from its profits. Since each building is considered to be a whole industrial sector and not just a single business, in order for more workers to be hired the building also needs to "hire" the employer as well. For example, with a given Production Method configuration, a single factory might require 1 Capitalist for every 2 Engineers for every 4 Machinists for every 10 Laborers in order to increase operation by one "step." For the sake of argument let's say this is the workforce of 1 (very) small business.  </p>
<p>Due to the rules of supply and demand, this actually means that the most profitable building from the employer's perspective is the one with <em>minimal throughput</em>, since this will keep input goods cost at minimum and output goods revenue at maximum. Being the only guy in town employing staff to produce these goods is obviously best. But from the perspective of the player, when they construct another "level" of Furniture Manufactories, they're developing the sector to a degree sufficient to employ maybe 5000 people, not 17. This means that in the game's fiction, there's actually several competing businesses opening operation, all clamoring for labor to realize their revenue. So even though it would be economically rational for the Furniture Manufactory "building" as a whole to cease hiring ASAP if they operated from the perspective of the best interest of the owner, that isn't going to happen. Instead the building operates from the perspective of what's rational for the <em>player</em>, who after all paid to lay the groundwork for all those new industries, and that is full employment. So as long as there's available jobs in the building, it will hire more and more people (including employers) even though this decreases the dividends for each individual employer. And if the building hits a point where it can no longer hire people at the current wage, it will increase the rate of wages it pays out if its profits permit, until it either runs out of profits to pay out or runs out of potential jobs to hire for.  </p>
<p>Subsistence Farms act in a way as the "elasticity" in the system, since redundant or grossly underpaid employees will return to working as Peasants on Subsistence Farms if there's room for them to do so.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27614310">Wizzington commented on Regarding the devs saying that we play as "soul of nation rather than leadership" to justify players building private industries</a></h4>
<p>This was specifically in response to the argument that it's 'unrealistic' for the player to be able to do things that are outside the purview of the government, even though there's plenty of other things players can do that makes no sense if you're just playing the government (such as backing a revolution to overthrow yourself).  </p>
<p>Ultimately what the player is and isn't allowed to do comes down to what the game loop is like, and which gameplay experiences we want to present. I recognize that there are people who would like the private economy sector part of the game to be a largely hands off experience (under certain economic systems), but we simply do not want one of the core features of the game to be locked off for the player. Building construction is so fundamental to how Victoria 3 plays that it would be akin to taking away the ability to declare war in EU4.  </p>
<p>As I said in the dev diary, we are considering how exactly to handle investment, and I'm not ruling out capitalist-directed investment/construction instead of a more player-controlled investment pool (or some sort of hybrid) if we can get it work well, but we are not going to block the player from constructing private industries with state money if they want to do so. If you want to get into the realism arguments here, state grants to private industries is something that happens all the time in real life and I do not know of any examples of capitalist countries outlawing spending government money in such a way.</p>

<p>I'm not sure the argument is that "the state cannot build factories" or "the state cannot give subsidies to build factories", but rather about the relative distribution of who builds how many factories. Granted, I'm not sure how the gameplay loop would change if you went to a model where individual capitalists build more of the factories versus the player (or where it is more economic for the player to put down different amounts of subsidies to get factories built, with no guarantee that those will be taken up).  </p>
<p>That said playing as "the spirit of the country" is kind of abstract, versus "playing as the government of the day". In the case of supporting a revolution, that might be thought of as changing who the player is (to the revolutionaries, rather than the government). It feels like an attempt to hybridize between HoI4, where you are clearly the government, and EU4 where you are a more abstract eminence grise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would challenge the idea that you're clearly playing the government in HOI4 given how many play-throughs depend on overthrowing the government to get a different ideology in power. Ultimately, who you play in our games is always going to be nebulous (even in Crusader Kings you can do things that are clearly against the interest of the character you're supposedly playing, like try to get killed in battle so your genius heir can take over) simply because of the scope of grand strategy. This is really only an issue if you overthink it, as <em>most</em> actions you take tend to fall within the scope of the government, or at least the ruling elite, but there's always exceptions simply because it's a game, not a perfect simulation of reality.</p>

<p>It's a tricky one; since the argument at face value makes sense and nobody's here actually played the game yet. Why take away a gameplay element from the player? Nobody likes being unable to DoW in EU either ... but, oh, here's the Regency Council, and suddenly you can't. Because that means events matter; there's actual weight to decisions and what's going on in the game even if it's inconvenient and annoying. It's not that anyone <em>like</em> being out of control, it's not that people expect an AI-controlled economy to be without it's annoyances, it's that it makes the decision on whether you want control or not an impactful and meaningful one.  </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, Victoria III was compared to "country gardening", this sort of "grow your own nation" sort of feel. But that's only interesting if there's also a challenge to it; otherwise I might as well just go and write out some embarrassing alt.history fiction and draw some imaginary borders on a map. If I want to achieve something, I want to have hurdles to overcome, and giving up control in exchange for something else is an interesting one (as we know from Vicky II).  </p>
<p>The other thing is that decision need to feel like they matter. Just having "+5% GDP" in a submenu, and, woo, now I got a different flag, that's a bit of flavor. And that's fine for a while, but surely we've moved beyond that? Mechanical differences are where the real meat is. This is a game after all.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, as with gardening, I might be into growing a bonsai, where I control every single piece every single day. Or I may be more into growing an organic garden where I just keep some broad control but otherwise enjoy looking into what it's growing into without my constant interference. And obviously if I want to grow a tropical garden in Scandanvia I got a real challenge at my hands, it shouldn't just be possibly because, hey, I have decided so ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do not confuse the ability to make decisions with the automatic ability to make <em>successful</em> decisions. The fact that we want to give the player more control over growing and shaping their economy doesn't mean that their decisions can't end up really bad for their nation. If anything, the ability to make decisions and see the cause and effect of how they play out is pretty much what a strategy game is all about.</p>

<p>I do want to clarify that regardless what solution we end up with for investment funds, the player will always be limited in how they can use them to uses that directly benefit the investor class, and will never be able to, for example, use investment fund money to expand government services or pay the army.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I fully understand and respect that this is the line in the sand that you have drawn for yourself, but that doesn't mean it's the universal line in the sand of what makes Victoria 3 a Victoria game (and by this logic, it also means that Victoria 2 was not a sequel to Victoria 1 since it radically changed how the economy worked from that game). Everyone will have a different idea of what is and is not necessary for a true Victoria game, and ultimately it's up to us as designers to try and deliver on our vision of what Victoria 3 should be while remaining open to feedback and course corrections.  </p>
<p>I have already stated on numerous occasions that the way the investment pool works right now may change to a less player-controlled model (and this was a conversation that was ongoing even before the announcement), but we're going to make that decision after discussing, trying things out, prototyping, and seeing what we actually feel works when we try it in-game. This is how our design process works and repeating your argument in harsher tones isn't going to change anything.</p>

<p>Look at the amount of detail that is going into the economy. It would be wildly inconsistent for the developers that designed that system to model something where there is no local administration. That makes no sense. If the point of the game is economy/political gardening, then building a local bureaucracy is clearly part of that.  </p>
<p>The only thing that is odd is that a developer hasn't just nipped this in the bud. Something like "We aren't idiots. Obviously, the government has some local presence and that will be modelled in game. The end." My assumption is they are busy or they are still working out the exact system or they aren't monitoring the forums that closely.  </p>

<p>Yes, you will be able to do this. It will be a balancing act, because the aristocracy and the proletariat tend to have different ideas about how a country should be run.

<p>I'm not disagreeing on a historical basis, but when it comes to actually creating mechanics, implementing canals in such a way means we'd basically be adding something that's directly competing with an early tech that the player would know is better in the long run.

<p>How well will Vic3 handle situations like what happened in the USA leading up to the Civil War? For example, the US was hesitant to ratify certain territories into statehood, in fear that they would take a pro-slavery stance.  </p>
<p>If we were in a similar situation in Vic3, would the game "know" which IG to support in regards to slavery/abolition (based perhaps on geographic regions, ie; north/south), or will we more likely see arbitrary blobs where a state or two in the north may be pro-slavery, one or two in the south favor abolitionists? In the US at least, it was very geographically based (hence the reluctancy to ratify statehood for southern territories at the time).  </p>
<p>Would love to try and navigate through my own A House Divided scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is entirely emergent from the simulation, which at the moment runs a little something like this:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wealthy Aristocrats are more likely to support the Landowner Interest Group, which in the USA's case is called the Southern Planters and have a pro-Slavery stance  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The American south has a lucrative Plantation industry at game start, with potential to expand that doesn't exist in the north  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pops in incorporated states gain more Political Strength than Pops in unincorporated states  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealthier Pops gain more Political Strength on account of their wealth  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More Political Strength means more power over the country's Laws, and a stronger reaction if the player tries to move away from favored Laws  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which means that it's the relative profitability of the American south's slave plantations that cause the Southern Planters to have the political support they do. If the player nurtures this type of plantation economy the institution of slavery will become an even more dominant and important fixture of US politics, whereas if they shift their economy towards manufacturing industries (perhaps in part fueled by resources from plantations in UNincorporated states, where the Aristocrats may be wealthy but not as politically empowered) or service/government workers, they <em>may</em> be able to effect a political shift away from slavery without a civil war.</p>

<p>I can see your point, but at the same time we didn't want the first couple of weeks of discussion about Victoria 3 to just be an endless debate on whether or not there would be mana in the game, which is likely what would have happened if we'd said nothing on the subject. Ultimately though, everyone has their own definition of the word and I think the more relevant point is what degree of abstraction is suitable for each particular game: in Victoria 3 we're striving for more grounded mechanics in general.</p>

<p>But Ragamuffin war already at full war in early 1836 is a mistake.  </p>
<p>Regency era was very unstable in Brazil. There were two main groups in 1836 Moderados (Moderated) and Exaltados (Exalteds), that were struggling for power. The Moderados, that in 1840 would become the Conservatives, were for centralized power and were supported by upper classes. The Exaltados, the Liberals were for federal power and had more support of lower classes.  </p>
<p>The Ragamuffin war started because they wanted more autonomy, with a federal system. Another issue was economical, they wanted more tariffs, because they were the biggest producer of meat, but foreign meat was much more cheaper to import and buy in brazilian market.  </p>
<p>The Ragamuffin rebelled in september 1835, expelled the governor, sent a letter to regent explaing the situation and appointed a new governor, they considered that the rebellion ended at that point, because at start separatism wasn't an issue, they were more of a particularist revolt. But the regent appointed a new governor in late 1835, to have full control of state, but only arrived in january 1836, sent an army and then deposed the ragamuffin governor, but the war fully started in september 1836.  </p>
<p>So at that point the player can decide if support the ragamufin governor and the liberal faction or expel the governor and support the conservative. There should be an option to rebel too and form another nation.  </p>
<p>Doesn't make sense for a liberal player, to start the game killing a liberal revolt, that is considered in game as nationalist, but actually didn't even fully started. Tariffs were an issue too, so for a high tariff Brazil, this wouldn't had happened too.</p>

<p>Generally we're not representing every tributary of Qing as a subject, it depends on how much the Qing government tended to meddle in their domestic affairs in the mid-19th century.  </p>

<p>According to logic, other parts of the tsarist empire should also have some kind of status. If you do something like that, it should be a general game mechanic. You either don't have enough control over a province or you have certain rights to keep the people quiet. For example, I can exempt Poland from compulsory military service, but still collect taxes. Or they can determine their own market. Or I allow the state to have its own army.  </p>
<p>The problem with an independent Finland is simple. I have to annex the land directly, probably by conquest, if I want direct control. But that's not how it happened historically. At the turn of the century, the tsarist empire tried to gradually curtail rights. It was a process and not a relationship between two subjects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We try to make a historical judgment on how much autonomy different parts of empires had when deciding whether they should be an annexed incorporated, annexed unincorporated, or subject (of varying degrees of autonomy). For example we considered whether Poland should be a puppet instead of annexed territory, but their autonomy was basically entirely gone by 1836 so it didn't really make sense to us.</p>

<p>This brings up a related issue in my mind. One area of the economy that V1 and V2 did not really model was the rise of the service economy in the late 19th century - everything from retail workers to office staff composed a large part of the new industrial economy yet their socioeconomic interests were often very different from factory workers (and this played out in elections as political systems democratized, much of the political support for the center right and later far right comes from these groups in the early 20th century) .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The service economy is modelled in the form of urbanization and urban centers growing as a result of industralization, etc. These produce services (more on how services work in the future).</p>

<p>I will say this: If we were to ever add any more start dates to the game at some point, I think 1821 would be the strongest candidate - but for release at least we want to focus on the 'core century' 1836-1936.</p>

<h4><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/goto/post?id=27551323">Wizzington commented on How should Austria-Hungary be represented?</a></h4>
<p>To my best understanding of history, Hungary did not have enough autonomy in 1836 to be accurately represented as a subject state at that time. You could make an argument for it after Austria became A-H but a very crucial part of A-H was Hungarian privileges and ambitions in regards to shared domination over other parts of the empire, so I'm not sure about that either. I'm of course open to changing my mind if there are compelling enough sources on the subject to indicate they should start as a subject.</p>

<p>What would be the consequences of removing all of those provinces, though? If Hungary is a separate country, even as a subject, what happens to Austria's industrial and military scores? Is prestige enough to keep a rump Austria as a great power? Also what about the rest of the realm? Would Lombardy-Venetia and Bohemia also be subjects?  </p>
<p>I have to ask you because I can only go on the rules of how Vicky2 worked to kind of pictures how any of this would work out. Obviously Vicky3 is going to be using different fundamentals but it seems like a dubious prospect so far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subjects' GDP and military power gives prestige to overlords in V3, so it shouldn't be a huge issue in terms of keeping Austria a GP (and shared market means they can still access Hungarian goods). I'm skeptical that it makes sense historically, though.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Any country that was an 'unciv' in V2 is likely what we call an 'unrecognized nation' in V3 (basically a state of not being recognized as a potential equal by the European Great Powers which is penalizing mainly in terms of diplomacy and being seen as a legitimate target of conquest by recognized countries).  </p>
<p>Those countries generally start with a lower level of technology (the degree to which will vary based on historical research - there are of course differences in the starting technology level of recognized powers too) and might have laws that make it difficult to industrialize but they don't have anything like '-25% to GDP due to being unrecognized'.</p>

<p>What we're aiming for is to give the player the agency to try and direct their country the way they please - but not with any guaranteed success. You make the choices, but that also means you have to deal with the consequences and reactions from the people in your nation who disagree with those choices and who might seek to overturn them.  </p>
<p>I will say that I am not stating unequivocally that there will not be any autonomous construction of buildings though - just that the player will never be completely unable to interact with the building system, as it's such an integral part of the game's core loop.</p>

<p>I'm going to be honest, if any European power is ahead of Great Britain in 1836 and it <em>isn't</em> caused by player interaction, something has gone wrong.  </p>
<p>In 1836, the major powers of the world were all in Europe. China was in decline and the USA hadn't begun it's rise yet. France was in it's unstable "July Monarchy" even if it was the time period they went after Algeria and Russia only really began it's true ascent following the 1848 revolutions harming all the other powers in Europe. Austria, for all that it was just ending a period of being the dominant power in Europe, was only the dominant power in <em>Europe.</em>  </p>
<p>Britain was the only power to have anything like a global reach during the time period and oddly one of the only major powers of the time to properly industrialise. Russia and Austria-Hungary can be counted alongside Spain for countries that performed a rapid industrialisation in the <em>20th</em> century. Although at least with Spain they had the sense to industrialise a decent part of their country in the 1800s.  </p>
<p>France and Germany, while they did Industrrialise properly. were not really major powers in 1836 when compared to Austria, Britain, Russia or even the Ottomans. The French were unstable and untrusted due to Napoleon and had very little reach and Germany had a good few years to go before becoming Germany rather than Prussia.</p>

<h4>AAR : V3 OFFICIAL AAR #1 by Martin "Wiz" Anward</h4>
<p>I will start the AAR here in little more than 30 minutes. As I play, I'll be taking screenshots quite a bit and trying to answer some questions from the AAR chat channel (the answers will be written here). Since this is the first 'official' AAR, I'd just like to remind people that I will be playing on hot code, so while the aim is to play for about 8 hours (with a break or two), there's a chance my game might become unstable or otherwise break. If this happens, I'll try to pick it up or restart it at a later time.</p>
<p>I will be playing as the Ottomans, with the goal of building up a rural-based economy, maintaining conservative values and a traditional power structure while also trying to reform and strengthen the empire and retake lost lands.</p>
<p>It's OK to ping me in
v3-aar-general-chat to ask questions, just be aware that I will not answer every question. How many I answer will depend on how many there are and how much time it takes away from playing - it might be just a few, it might be a lot. With that in mind, please don't spam the same question.</p>
<p>Alright, it's time to start!</p>
<p>This is me, the Ottoman Empire of 1836, also known as the Sick Man of Europe. Now, you might be wondering how I got into this situation.</p>

<p>It is true that the Empire is weak, and in need of some reform. But the reason for that has nothing to do with our traditional ways of ruling, and everything to do with weak rulers who have allowed Western influences to creep into and weaken our realm. We will reform, and cast off the title of Sick Man, but we will do so in our own way, without losing who we are. We will crush the separatist movements, strengthen the army and retake Syria from the rebellious Governor of Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt was able to defeat us largely due to the poor state of the Ottoman army. Instead of maintaining a professional and well-equipped force, we rely heavily on a semi-feudal system of irregulars, which means that while on paper our army is quite large (and relatively cheap to maintain) it hasn't stood up well to Egypt's western-style forces. Our artillery is also outdated, and we depend on foreign imports to supply it.</p>

<p>We are a Major Power, with some potential to become a Great Power if we can get rid of the hefty prestige penalty from Sick Man of Europe. We have an old rivalry with Russia, and we maintain loose overlordship of Wallachia, Moldavia, Serbia and Tunis, as well as firmer control of Tripoli</p>

<p>Our first reform goal will be to Modernize the Army. There's a lot of areas we don't want to emulate the West in, but the army is one of them, as it's clear that we have no chance of reclaiming Syria, Egypt and our other lost territories otherwise. To do this, there's a few things we're going to need to do:
- Switch our Barracks from Irregulars to Line Infantry. This will require us to acquire a large supply of Small Arms.
- Research Napoleonic Warfare, and switch our artillery to Mobile Artillery. This means we need to fix our supply issues of Artillery.
- Build up a proper army reserve. To do this, we will need to reform our archaic levy system and either acquire more people to conscript, or increase our conscription rate by abolishing Jizya.</p>

<p>We invite them into the government. This opens up an opportunity to reform our army model. This is actually quite a popular idea, many of the IGs approve of it either inherently or because of their leader's ideology. However, the Landowners oppose it, which is going to make it somewhat tricky to pass while they're in the government. We're certainly not going to take their Allah-given right to rule away however, so we'll just have to try and convince them.</p>

<h4>AAR : Korea - Korea by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>Currently playing as Korea. To clarify something I said earlier: tributary subjects do not automatically join your market in the current build.</p>
<p>Though I did voluntarily join the Chinese market, they have stuff that I want</p>
<p>Everything really. I don't need to worry about most of my basic needs and can focus on having a more specialized economy where I sell luxuries to rich Chinese pops</p>
<p>Of course that does put all my eggs into one basket and this will fail massively if China collapses (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Veers</strong></p>
<p>Can I play too ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, just launch the secret steam app on the nightly build</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@replacethelamp</strong></p>
<p>cant you just join a better market</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd have to find a large economic power that would want me in their customs union. Right now China is my only option, but I'm sure things will change later in the game</p>
<p>One advantage of China over anyone else though is the sheer quantities of basic resources they produce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>Why would a country refuse you joining their market? My impression was the bigger my customs union the better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. Sometimes a bigger market just means more mouths to feed</p>
<p>It's situational</p>
<p>You have more economic power but that comes with economic responsibility</p>
<p>Exactly</p>
<p>You ideally want countries in your customs union that either make someone you want, or want something you have</p>
<p>Absolutely. I'm currently doing that with luxury clothing</p>
<p>Being part of the Chinese market I have a huge amount of silk, so I'm using that to make luxury clothes and selling it back to China</p>
<p>Which also helps me industrialize and change the makeup of my pops</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@replacethelamp</strong></p>
<p>can you sell you luxury cloths to other markets even though you aren't the market leader</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, the market leader handles all foreign trade</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>If I was china this would be the part where I would getting annoyed with you. You buying cheap and selling expensive, whats in for me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You get luxury clothes for your pops, saving you the trouble of diversifying your industry. You can use your money on developing something else that's more important to you.</p>
<p>It's symbiotic (edited)</p>
<p>You certainly could. And that would be great for me, because my clothes factories would become more profitable due to higher demand</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@random person</strong></p>
<p>why does AI china not produce expensive luxury clothes themselves if the nation has plenty of silk?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They certainly could. But they also have many, many other pop needs that they need to balance since they have millions of pops</p>
<p>Making luxury clothes isn't that high on the priority list</p>
<p>Compared to say, making sure there's enough rice for everyone to eat</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>Daniel, I have a small modding question, is it possible for "consumption" of goods to do something like increase a variable? Like increase a pollution variable when pops consume diesel cars</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure. You could do it at the point of manufacture though</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<p>Daniel, you should post some screenshots so that we can understand Korea's position better :))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think I'm allowed</p>
<p>I'm just playing for fun. I do occasionally note things down that I might want to bring up at work on Monday though</p>
<p>I would really really like to avoid going to war in my Korea game. My military is pathetic; China and Japan would murder me in a heartbeat if they tried. That's why I'm happy to be a Chinese tributary</p>
<p>Should start thinking about maybe not being a feudal backwater. I'll establish a university</p>
<p>I don't think that I will</p>
<p>hmm.. could really use some currency standards too</p>
<p>Oh right I should also have schools. Guess I'll go with religious schools since the monks are very powerful and would support it</p>
<p>Right now I've got the Landowners and Monks</p>
<p>Oh right I forgot that I made philosopher-kings overpowered.</p>
<p>Should tone that down.</p>
<p>But for now I'll exploit it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Hidra (She/Her)</strong></p>
<p>It´s not that you were going to play Korea so you made it intentionally overpowered for your game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah any country that doesn't start out with a large university can get this</p>
<p>Currency standards acquired. Now I probably need to focus on production tech. Eventually I'll run out of infrastructure and will need trains, and I have a lot of tech to catch up on before I can get them</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Hidra (She/Her)</strong></p>
<p>What is the most advanced tech you have?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I... know how to make steel. Korea is a little behind</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Miguelinileugim</strong></p>
<p>What is the link to the 40GB file containing the alpha you're playing right now?</p>

<p>12 people clicked this. You know who you are and you should think about the choices you have made in your life that led you down this path</p>
<p>Universities are expensive</p>
<p>Perhaps I should tax grain..</p>
<p>aha I got schools! Thanks monks</p>
<p>Actually instead of taxing grain it would be more efficient to just directly increase taxes on the peasantry</p>
<p>There's not really any political will right now to reform the status of the peasantry</p>
<p>I eventually want to introduce an income tax but that will take time and will annoy people</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>ram it through, for the good of the country  Can you do it with negative costs or is it simply impossible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would definitely cause a civil war at this point. Landowners like things the way they are and they are very powerful</p>
<p>Eventually industrialization will change the makeup of society such that landowners aren't so incredibly powerful, and then I'll be able to push through some less feudal reforms. But for now I'm stuck where I am on that front</p>
<p>Initially nobody. We'd important slaves. Unless we implemented debt slavery, in which case we'd enslave the poor</p>
<p>Which is kind of unnecessary since almost everyone is already a serf</p>
<p>My largest city is currently Pyongyang</p>
<p>Don't think there's a detailed GDP breakdown but my new luxury clothes and luxury furniture factories are the greatest contributors to the recent increases</p>
<p>If it's not in the slavery DD then I can't answer</p>
<p>Check the dev comments too, might be more info there</p>
<p>Alright I'm gonna take a risk, let's introduce a payroll tax</p>
<p>It occurs to me that my recent industrialization efforts have created a capitalist class that is fervently opposed to my taxation policy</p>
<p>They've created a Movement to oppose my law, but so far they're not TOO angry and they're only at 16% support</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Hidra (She/Her)</strong></p>
<p>WHat is the biggest IG not currently in the government?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monks. I kicked them out because I don't need them to enact my education reforms any more. Replaced them with the army, who support my tax reforms</p>
<p>Monks are fine with being kicked out of government, passing the law they liked made them very loyal</p>
<p>I kind of need to keep the landowners in government though, I just can't afford to annoy them and I'm never going to pass a law they approve of</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@random person</strong></p>
<p>how many chinese migrants are you getting as korea?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None, my borders are closed</p>
<p>I would like to open them one day but that is low on my priority list</p>

<p><strong>@random person</strong></p>
<p>assuming your pops are much richer than the chinese would it not mean a mass immigration would happen once you open them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My pops are only slightly richer on average compared to the Chinese average. Oh and also my laws are super racist. Chinese pops are more likely to move to larger Chinese cities.</p>
<p>I want to expand my schools but I need bureaucracy, which is expensive</p>
<p>Really hope my tax laws pass</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Zombie_Freak115</strong></p>
<p>Best move is enact super progressive rainbow laws like the flash and use the army to crush any disagreement and become the Beacon of progressivism and development in Asia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will definitely not work</p>
<p>The guy who was writing my tax laws died</p>
<p>Petite Bourgeoisie have become pretty powerful. Considering changing my government to them and the Industrialists, then passing anti-feudalism laws</p>
<p>My tax law passed. I am.. now very wealthy</p>
<p>Time to totally reform society</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Miguelinileugim</strong></p>
<p>Are there any downsides to taxing the elites and using the money to help the peasants</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. The elites will hate you and they typically have a lot of political power</p>
<p>With my new tax laws I can set taxes to minimum and still have a positive balance</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<p>What is your relationship with China now? A tributary, certainly, but is there a tendency towards something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things are stable. Relations are good because I've been boosting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Miguelinileugim</strong></p>
<p>That seems a bit unbalanced</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's partially due to the fact that I don't have a lot of the expenses that more developed countries have. And I will want to take on those expenses to develop my economy and society. Tax income is nice but you really ought to be using it to grow your GDP and appease your pops (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Miguelinileugim</strong></p>
<p>Sweet! Can you still run the economy in a market fashion by having low taxes and using pop money to fund expansion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You certainly can, but that money can only be invested into certain things</p>
<p>Easy there, I still have less than 1/10 of China's GDP</p>
<p>I'm making ground on Japan though, almost at 1/2</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<p>Excellent, excellent! We are still a monarchy, right? Daniel! Please tell me that our eternal right to rule is as true today as it was 100 years ago!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is. Abolishing the monarchy would be a pretty bad idea right now. The monarchy is giving us much needed legitimacy to pass laws</p>
<p>Korea is not ready for democracy. Maybe in a decade</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<p>The way Daniel is describing it, Korea sounds more like a second Siam rn than a second Japan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah that's more or less how I'm playing this. Only thing that's missing is western powers taking an interest in what I'm doing</p>
<p>We are just BARELY, BARRELY below the threshold for a revolution</p>
<p>I'm abolishing serfdom. The landowners are angry</p>
<p>It occurs to me that this would be an excellent time to use my tax money to double military salaries. Just in case.</p>
<p>I want the generals on my side</p>
<p>I've also centralized the power of the armed forces in the capital and reduced their presence in the countryside where the landowners are powerful</p>
<p>YES serfdom is abolished</p>
<p>I think I should now not pass any more dangerous reforms for a little while</p>
<p>I could open up my economy. Nobody has strong feelings about transitioning from isolationism to agrarianism. It's not a big jump but it makes my tech spread less terrible</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>People would actually support Landed Voting (edited)</p>
<p>Actually no I want to keep the monarchy for now. Landed Voting could have unforeseen consequences</p>
<p>People might vote for things I don't like</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captaincat</strong></p>
<p>Hold up there was monarchy in  Korea? The more you know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah for like thousands of years</p>
<p>One consequence of abolishing serfdom: subsistence farms are now producing less grain due to not being forced to hand over their grain to the aristocracy. This has slightly increased food prices. Thankfully I'm in the Chinese market so this is barely noticable</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Fellington, Micro Knight</strong></p>
<p>Wouldnt serfs leave the land when freed and go into urban areas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. I expect that social mobility will increase. But I'm industrializing anyway so should have plenty of jobs for them</p>
<p>Will probably want to enact Poor Laws once the migration gets overwhelming though</p>
<p>Oh no I looked away on speed 5 and there's a revolution</p>
<p>I have a solution</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</strong></p>
<p>If you savescum, you lose -5 with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah I've got this. I'll see if they raise an army I can't beat - if they do then I'll just get China to help</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captaincat</strong></p>
<p>I have a question, is it possible for more traditionlist pops like aristocrats to maybe reform with education and become a leading reformist group?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individual landowner leaders can be more or less traditionalist, but they're a fundamentally reactionary group</p>
<p>Ah the revolution is over. I won decisively, didn't even need China</p>
<p>After the revolution, the power of the landowners has been crushed. I now have the freedom to pass laws they will REALLY hate</p>
<p>Gonna start by replacing hereditary bureaucrats with appointed bureaucrats. Yay meritocracy.</p>
<p>It is time to build railways. I'm going to need... a lot of stuff. Coal, steel, motors. Nothing I can rely on China to make for me.</p>
<p>I need to build a lot of stuff fast. Will research a better construction PM. Which will increase the resources I need to construct stuff but I have money so it's fine</p>
<p>1845</p>
<p>A lot has happened in 9 years</p>
<p>Germany is a mess. Prussia and Austria and fighting</p>
<p>I am. To do this I've had to spend most of the time at the very edge of collapse. It's a dangerous game.</p>
<p>Austria and Prussia are fighting over the liberation of Krakow</p>
<p>Yes but those participants have since decided they don't want to be involved in this</p>
<p>Prussia is winning</p>
<p>AI is... very not done yet</p>
<p>Oh. Slovakia, Krakow, and Galicia-Lodomeria are now independent countries</p>
<p>We're actually very pleased with the reception so far</p>
<p>We've got a much broader view of reception from multiple sources</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<p>The funniest comment I have seen personally was about someone claiming the Vic3 devs have never played Vicky 2. Some people don't even seem to know who wiz is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been pretty open about the fact that I don't like V2. It had lots of cool ideas that were imo not executed well. Also the UI was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>But as I think people can tell, I'm enjoying V3 a lot</p>
<p>My railways are insanely profitable</p>
<p>My personal take on this is that the core gameplay loop is focused on the economic and political aspects of the game - intense military micro would be a distraction from that and would actively make the game less fun (edited)</p>
<p>My railway now runs all the way down my country and connects all my cities. There are little trains on the map chugging along. This is good.</p>

<h4>AAR : Russia - Russia by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>So, what's going on in Russia? Tsar Nikolai Romanov rules over a largely pre-industrial peasant society. He rules with an iron fist, the monarchy backed up by repressive laws like Autocracy, Censorship, and Serfdom</p>
<p>The economy is... functional. We're not running a deficit by default. IT's mostly based on peasant agriculture, supervised by the aristocracy. The government's budget comes almost entirely (around 80%) from taxes specifically on the peasantry</p>
<p>Though we're also getting a good amount of money from a consumption tax on liquor</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@JoJo (Stellaris QA Lead)</strong></p>
<p>Whats our demographics?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around half the population is Russian, with Poles, Ukrainians and Belorussians making up the largest minorities. Of these, we discriminate against Poles, as well as nearly all of the many other minorities in Russia (edited)</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of people follow the Russian Orthodox Church</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Balkan Devastation Enjoyer</strong></p>
<p>any minorities we don't discriminate against yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ukrainians and Belorussians</p>
<p>We have a significant (maybe 10%) Catholics minority, as well as a few Muslims of various schools and a smattering of Protestants</p>
<p>Political power from pops (disregarding other factors) is firmly in the hands of the aristocrats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Wesh</strong></p>
<p>Do you discriminate against a Culture or a Religion separately or you can choose to only target Catholic Poles for example (combination of culture+religion)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're separate. But we enforce a State Religion, so non-Orthodox pops are discriminated against. It is not a good time to be a Catholic Pole</p>
<p>Overall, the poor are barely able to feed themselves while the rich live relatively luxurious lives. We're going to widen that gap even further - our goal today is human misery</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Tripledot</strong></p>
<p>how are the tatars doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not great. They're discriminated against</p>
<p>The diplomatic situation is undeveloped. We have a Personal Union with Finland, which is in our Market. Greece owes us a Favor. Britain is our Rival</p>
<p>We probably want to make a friend. As an opening move, I'm going to propose an alliance with fellow reactionary monarchy, Austria</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the internal political situation..</p>
<p>The government is made up exclusively of the landowning aristocracy</p>
<p>They are powerful and enjoy the full backing of the Tsar</p>
<p>The Orthodox Church is also powerful, but not part of the government. They are fairly neutral towards the government, leaning positive. I want to make them loyal, and I have some ideas about how to achieve that</p>
<p>There's also a significant but not yet powerful capitalist industrial class. They're also neutral, but leaning negative. I have mixed feelings about these guys. They might be useful, but they might also be a thorn in our side (edited)</p>
<p>I have no intention of allowing free trade</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@kebb</strong></p>
<p>how are the nascent intelligensia?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hahahaha. Marginalized. Actively. We pour a lot of our authority into keeping them that way.</p>
<p>Liberalism is not tolerated in Russia</p>
<p>Here's something that I find VERY concerning. The armed forces are decently strong, but they seem to really despise the government. This is a big problem. We need their loyalty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MingorSolum</strong></p>
<p>Just pay them. Alot. (edited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well it turns out that one of the reasons for their disloyalty is our low military wages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Balkan Devastation Enjoyer</strong></p>
<p>we're not running a deficit right? increase their wages and go into a deficit. Nothing bad can come out of this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've increased their wages t othe point that they're getting no penalties or bonuses from them. This took up 1/3 of our remaining budget</p>
<p>They're still unhappy but at least not actively disloyal. We'll need to pass some laws that they like (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Balkan Devastation Enjoyer</strong></p>
<p>what laws do they like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well we could ramp up the censorship, institute police or national guard, introduce new conscription laws..</p>
<p>I think I'm going to start out by trying to pass a law called Outlawed Dissent. It's like Censorship but MORE. All of the important interest groups approve of this - the landowners, the church, and the military. The rest either don't care or they're so marginalized that I don't care about their objections</p>
<p>The best part is that when the law passes, their objections will be even more irrelevant</p>
<p>We're starting out with a 37% chance to pass the law on the enactment timer, and an extremely high chance of advancing its progress even if it doesn't pass first time</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Balkan Devastation Enjoyer</strong></p>
<p>good, we're running a perfect government already</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is actually what inspired this playthrough</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Illusive_S</strong></p>
<p>whats the timer? days? weeks? months?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's January, and we'll next see a result in August</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>It's January, and we'll next see a result in August</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a relatively short time, because it's a law supported by most relevant aspects of society (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MingorSolum</strong></p>
<p>Daniel how is the world looking right now? Any major crises or is the world peaceful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've barely unpaused</p>
<p>I should also start building things and deciding where to focus my tech. I don't currently have the required tech for police, so that seems like a good start. And when I get that tech I'll need a lot of bureaucracy to run my police forces. So I should build Government Administrations</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@PanShot</strong></p>
<p>Where does tech even come from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having Universities helps. But the downside of that is that you have more annoying students who want "rights" and "equality" and such</p>
<p>I've noticed that there is an immense demand for Fish. I will focus the entire economy of the Baltic states towards producing fish</p>
<p>We could alos use more Tools. Mazovia has a tooling workshop. I guess I'll expand it</p>
<p>And on the topic of widening the wealth gap - our poor aristocrats are struggling to buy luxurious silk outfits. The price of luxury clothes is far too high. I could either import them, or start producing them myself. Let's see if I have any source of silk..</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>@Daniel "neondt" Tolman Do you start the game with any railways?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russia does not appear to have any railways</p>
<p>Alright, switching my textile mills to luxury clothes is a terrible idea. We have no silk</p>
<p>I suppose I'll import some</p>
<p>hmm.. for various reasons (we haven't really talked about trade so I'll gloss over this), I'm struggling to import any silk</p>
<p>I can't make silk myself, nor can I import it. This leaves only one option: importing the clothes directly. It would be better to import raw materials and manufacture them myself because it's good for the economy. But alas that's not an option in this case</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>@Daniel "neondt" Tolman How is market access in this situation? Are states forced to be relatively self supporting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things seem fine for now. Lack of industrialization means little need for infrastructure</p>
<p>Having now established the import of 450 luxury clothes from Great Britain, the price of these goods as dropped significantly. Finally the poor archdukes can afford a silk coat!</p>
<p>We should hopefully see the Standard of Living for upper-class pops increase as a result. And since they're richer, they have more political clout, reinforcing the political balance of power that I want</p>
<p>There's also a desire for meat and fabric. I'm more concerned about the high price of fabric because it's a building material that the government has to buy in order to construct things</p>
<p>You know where I can get both meat and fabric? Sheep</p>
<p>The steppe around Astrakhan has some livestock ranches. I'll improve those</p>
<p>Ah I can also grow Cotton in the Caucasus. So I shall</p>
<p>Maybe exclusively growing cash crops in that region will come back to bite me some day. But that's a problem for future Russia</p>
<p>As a result of all this construction, we're now running a small deficit. It's not enough that I'm going to institute any additional taxes yet. I'll need that later, but for now I'm just spending money to make money</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Doodlez - Fotp</strong></p>
<p>Construction is also a jobs program so we are good on another front too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people are subsistence farmers, so unemployment isn't really an issue for Russia</p>
<p>hmm, even with my consumption taxes and suppressing the intelligentsia, I have plenty of Authority to spare. Tempted to leave it unspent, since having more than you need speeds up law enactment time</p>
<p>And I do want my Outlawed Dissent</p>
<p>Russian government: the price of tools is a bit high, let's make more
Prussian government: Let's import tools from Russia</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Doodlez - Fotp</strong></p>
<p>That is good for Russia coin right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My tooling workshops will be more profitable, but I don't care about their profitability. I want them to make cheap tools for my construction</p>
<p>It's not like I care about the people working in these factories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@PENAPENA</strong></p>
<p>Is there a way to cut off trading a particular item?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no ability to embargo or discourage goods. My economic laws are really backwards</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Hokki</strong></p>
<p>But think of the children Daniel!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am thinking of the children!</p>

<p>You know what, maybe switching to a different economic model might be good. I'm currently using Traditionalism, which is bureaucratically cheap but is otherwise just bad. Agrarianism would give me an Investment Pool from the Aristocrats, and give me a lot more economic options</p>
<p>But that'll have to wait, currently too busy with ultra-censorship (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@PENAPENA</strong></p>
<p>Is there support for Agrarianism?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is! It would be widely supported by the aristocracy and the peasantry alike</p>
<p>Even the Industrialists see it as an improvement over not having an economic system at all</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Doodlez - Fotp</strong></p>
<p>Getting money from Aristocrats for investments sounds like a better way rather than taxing them outright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. Taxing the rich is not on my agenda today</p>
<p>Instead they're free to exploit their serfs to their heart's content, so they'll invest in more farms to exploit more serfs!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@liberty90</strong></p>
<p>@Daniel "neondt" Tolman So for now there was no investment pool?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. All expansion is at the government's expense (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@liberty90</strong></p>
<p>Would agrarianism prohibit using gov treasury for econ expansion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I'd be mostly limited to using the money on agriculture</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Jüstinyen</strong></p>
<p>How  industrialized are you rn? Is there at least 1 factory in every state?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you seen Siberia?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Doodlez - Fotp</strong></p>
<p>The investment pool money that is right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I can still spend government funds on whatever I want</p>
<p>Decided to check on the price of iron. It's fine. But could be more fine. A few more mines would be nice</p>
<p>I'll mine in the Urals</p>
<p>Russia surprisingly has some fairly large urban centers. But that urbanization is not coming from factories. It is almost entirely from military buildings</p>
<p>I've declared an Interest in the Balkans, Manchuria, and Japan (I'm going to want Sakhalin)</p>
<p>We are also VERY slowly colonizing Kazakhstan</p>
<p>I could speed it up but I can't afford the bureaucratic expense. Besides we want to use that on Police</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>Other than Divine Right why do you want Sakhalin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's got a bit of everything. Iron, coal, whales, fish, and wood</p>
<p>Of course we're barely even exploiting the riches of Siberia yet</p>
<p>We have an immense reserve of completely untapped resources</p>
<p>Oh something is happening</p>
<p>Austria has started a Diplomatic Play against Prussia. They want Silesia</p>
<p>Austria has a much stronger military, and honestly I would prefer the balance of power in Germany to stay the same. But as Austria's ally I am not able to take Prussia's side</p>
<p>My leaning here is to Declare Neutrality on this issue</p>
<p>The Ottomans, presumably for similar reasons, are leaning towards Prussia</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ulf "UlfDerDritte" III</strong></p>
<p>wouldn't it be a good idea to weaken Prussia, since it has a lot of potential untapped at the start?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has potential. But Austria is currently dominant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Illusive_S</strong></p>
<p>i imagine if you declare participation in diplo play and it blows up into a full scale war, you are instantly a participant?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>The deficit is a bit more significant now, since I'm also investing in the lumber industry a bit, for the same reasons that I'm building Iron mines. I want to lower the cost of construction. Still not quite enough that I'll institute new taxes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ulf "UlfDerDritte" III</strong></p>
<p>tbf, he doesn't like that Prussia is buying the tools</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Prussia buying my tools means they're more expense for my government to buy</p>
<p>The Ottomans have officially join Prussia's side. This just slightly tips the odds in Prussia's favor</p>
<p>Prussia has some interesting goals. They want to conquer parts of Poland, and in the process liberate the city of Krakow</p>
<p>If Krakow gets liberated I might just... eat it up</p>
<p>Prussia why. Groceries are quite expensive in Russia and they just opened new imports. I wonder if Prussia is deliberately doing this...</p>
<p>Can't tell if AI is waging economic warfare or just determined that I'm a good source of food for some reason</p>
<p>Prussia is very wary of us</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>To do this, would Prussia's grocery prices be even higher than Russias?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite possibly. Looking at their market, they now have cheap groceries. Presumably because they're stealing mine.</p>
<p>Just in case I'm going to start damaging relations with Prussia</p>
<p>If they actually win against Austria they'll be quite powerful</p>
<p>Outlawed Dissent did not pass immediately. But the Petite Bourgeoisie have decided that they really love this law, increasing the chance of it passing next time</p>
<p>Oh dear, it's escalating into a war</p>
<p>I'm hoping for a bloody stalemate where nobody really wins</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ezno</strong></p>
<p>Time to nation ruin at the start of the game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bruno Carvalho</strong></p>
<p>Have you backed someone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I Declared Neutrality, which blocks me from ever interfering military in this play</p>
<p>Maybe if someone is winning too hard I could open an export route for guns..</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MingorSolum</strong></p>
<p>what do the rest of the Europeans think about this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both sides have made outrageous demands, increasing their infamy. They're not getting involved but they are not going to be happy if either side manages to win decisively</p>
<p>Since I'm looking at the diplomatic situation, I noticed that neighboring Moldavia in an Ottoman Protectorate, but not economically tied to them. They have their own market, and it is small and not performing well. They would join our customs unions if we offered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@EditedDruid</strong></p>
<p>What can they bring to the market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing of value. They're peasant farmers like us</p>
<p>I think I'll leave them to their squalor</p>
<p>(I say squalor but their SoL is higher than most of Russia, partially due to being less massively repressive)</p>
<p>Moldavia did just start buying our Clothes. Just regular clothes, not luxury clothes. I have no strong opinion about this.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Saxony (a minor non-negotiating participant in the war) has occupied Bohemia</p>
<p>While Austria has occupied Bosnia</p>
<p>That's sure to go well</p>
<p>oh no. game crashed</p>
<p>This is the hottest of hot code. Build is from yesterday</p>
<p>Let's se if I can find a save that won't crash..</p>
<p>Unfortunately even the older autosaves are crashing. Must be some issue with loading, in addition to whatever caused the original issue.</p>
<p>I'll grab the crash log and file a report. But unfortunately that means the end of the playthrough</p>
<p>That's what I get for not playing on the recommended stable build. I wanted to try out some new changes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bruno Carvalho</strong></p>
<p>We can fix that, you can pick the stable build and play Brazil in it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hmm..</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>I feel like dev stable is not nearly as stable as the stable version we will receive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely not. Stable doesn't (to my knowledge) have known crashes but that doesn't mean it's anything close to bug-free. (edited)</p>
<p>I think I'll save Brazil for another day</p>
<p>But maybe Krakow death run</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>So @Daniel "neondt" Tolman , by the end of your run, what year was it?</p>

<p>I think I only played around 2 years</p>
<p>I enjoyed it regardless of the abrupt ending. It's a noticeably different playstyle to what I usually go with (rapid industrialization and social progressivism). Just goes to show how much variety there is in the game.</p>

<p><strong>@Tripledot</strong></p>
<p>I wonder if it's possible to preserve the edo bakufu (if that's even implemented yet)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can totally do that. It's probably a terrible idea, but you can!</p>
<p>The Restoration path for Japan is a whole lot of fun. It's by far my favorite run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Also, you said that you wanted Sakhalin, does that mean that it was controlled by the Japanese?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not at game start. It's within the Japanese strategic region though, which means I need an interest there to colonize it.</p>
<p>Japan also has a Claim on it</p>
<p>Another run I'd like to do in the future is Canadian Unification</p>
<p>While staying loyal to Britain</p>
<p>It is drastically easier to unify Canada while you remain loyal</p>
<p>Otherwise you'd have to fight a lot of wars</p>
<p>It's split into 5 different colonies, plus the British-owned Newfoundland and Labrador</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ezno</strong></p>
<p>How long does it normally take to unify them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haven't tried it, but should be possible in a bit less than 30 years if you speedrun it</p>
<p>But realistically, around 50 (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Tripledot</strong></p>
<p>can you play as the patriotes and form quebec?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Lower Canada is a Franco-Canadian country subject to the British Empire at game start. If you manage to secure your independence, you become Quebec</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MojnMojn</strong></p>
<p>Can you unify canada as lower canada and get all of it as french</p>

<p>You totally can</p>
<p>Another fun playthrough - opium-exporting Sikh Empire</p>

<p>It does</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@EditedDruid</strong></p>
<p>I imagine it would be possible but really hard</p>

<p>This</p>
<p>Maybe if you can get China to help you, but they have their own issues going on</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@EditedDruid</strong></p>
<p>What would you say is the hardest start in the game?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piratini. They can't really win their starting war</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ezno</strong></p>
<p>There was no war, he just got a civil war and rage quit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be quite hard to get into a civil war that early while supporting the most dominant interest groups</p>

<h4>AAR : Schaumburg-Lippe - Schaumburg-Lippe by Martin "Wiz" Anward</h4>
<p>So Schamburg-Lippe is the smallest and most pathetic nation in Europe, with a population of 23.8k and a GDP of 6.55k. As a way of comparison, Luxemburg (not exactly a powerhouse) has a population of 175k and a GDP of 181k.</p>
<p>And yes, that's a GDP just short of 7 thousand</p>
<p>I have a single-province state in Westphalia with 6 arable land (actually should be less, but in this branch they're slightly overpowered) and a little bit of potential for coal, iron, wood and sulfur</p>
<p>It's not all bad though. I do have a few things going for me: A decent literacy rate at 51.3% and (crucial to my strategy) the Ruhr Coalfields State Trait, which boosts coal production by 10%</p>
<p>Now, we only have potential for 2 levels of coal mines, but as my workforce amounts to just above 5k (enough for a single level of building) that's good enough</p>
<p>Hence, my plan is to turn all of Schaumburg-Lippe into a coal mine supplying the Prussian Market</p>
<p>My first move is to ask big papa Prussia if I can be their Protectorate, because I certainly won't be doing any protecting myself</p>
<p>They say yes, which is nice. Being a Protectorate means I'm a subject, but a very autonomous one. I don't pay any tribute, I don't have to be part of their market (I want to though) and I just give up some diplomatic independence. So long as they maintain a nice attitude towards me and don't want to make me a Puppet, this is great.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Deleted User</strong></p>
<p>Will they accept though? Is there any case under which the AI might reject protectorate request?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, depending on their attitude they might want nothing to do with you</p>
<p>There is one other advantage to me being so pathetic: With so few people to administrate, I have a pretty decent surplus of bureaucracy just from the base capacity generated by my nation. I start growing my police institution, just in case my coal miners ever start getting ideas.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I've started construction of a single level of coal mines and research into water-tube boiler (which will improve the efficiency of said mine)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@BOBA THICC</strong></p>
<p>How are the interest groups looking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well really, the landowners and church are the only ones of any significance</p>
<p>That'll change once we get going in the coal mining business though</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Deleted User</strong></p>
<p>So it’s just a way for you to be turned into a puppet in the future</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. The AI might decide it's not worth the trouble of reigning in my autonomy. I'm banking on this really.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>So. What happens when Prussia forms something bigger?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Prussia forms something bigger and I'm still their subject, I get absorbed into that something. So let's hope that doesn't happen.</p>
<p>My cousins in Lippe apparently think that family feuds are all the rage, as they just declared themselves my rival</p>
<p>well whatever, they can take it up with Prussia</p>
<p>I start improving relations with both Prussia and Austria, never hurts to suck up to the big boys</p>
<p>I also issue a decree to encourage resource industries, which will help once my little mine is up and running</p>
<p>and another decree to attract migrants, though the prospects of that aren't too great at the moment, given our low standard of living</p>
<p>Funny you should mention that, I've already tapped out my gold reserve and am now taking loans</p>
<p>but I'm confident I can pay those off down the line</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Dont you start out with any production beyond sustinence?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, no starting buildings at all</p>
<p>And pretty much my entire income is from minting coins with my chubby count on htem</p>
<p>Subsistence farms</p>
<p>Since those appear anywhere with unused arable land</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, my strategy to appear migrants is actually working! I have a small trickle of sorbs moving in from Saxony, it seems</p>
<p>and immediately, my newspapers start printing articles blaming the Sorbs for everything</p>
<p>I have an education institution at level 2</p>
<p>(The newspaper thing is an event)</p>
<p>I decide to suppress the article since honestly I need whatever immigration I can get</p>
<p>Well, not a month passed and my projected migration is back in the red</p>
<p>It was nice while it lasted</p>
<p>I guess I should've been paying a bit more attention to my radicals. It seems that the wages I pay to construction workers is basically so low they'd have a better life as subsistence farmers, and the people I drafted to build my coal mines are miffed about this</p>
<p>Well, nothing for it, keep building those coal mines</p>
<p>it'll all get better at some point</p>
<p>This is also why my migration attraction tanked</p>
<p>radicals are causing turmoil</p>
<p>I'm still up 500 people from when I started though</p>
<p>Police helps mitigate penalties from turmoil, so I'm going to keep expanding that institution</p>
<p>My coal mines are done!</p>
<p>Now they just need to hire people to work there</p>
<p>I'm going to subsidize them to speed up the process, as this isn't just a vital industry, it's our only industry</p>
<p>We currently lack enough qualifications to fully staff the coal mine, but even running at half capacity, it's made our GDP jump several times over</p>
<p>I'm going to invest in more education</p>
<p>so I can teach the aristocrats to be mine owners instead</p>
<p>I guess they need to go to mine owner school or something</p>
<p>Currently, 9k out of 24.1k people in Schaumburg-Lippe are radicals</p>
<p>This isn't... great</p>
<p>I have 43 loyalists though!</p>
<p>Also, the price of coal is very high in the Prussian market right no</p>
<p>w</p>
<p>so the mine is doing quite well</p>
<p>Unfortunately the mine owners are hogging most of that money for themselves and paying peanut wages right now</p>
<p>but at least SoL should rise a little from the days of forced construction work</p>
<p>Sure, let me just ask my interest groups</p>
<p>Turns out they all say no</p>
<p>It isn't even like the regular people are demanding that or anything, they're just angry peasants forced to build and work in a coal mine</p>
<p>I'd have to spend quite a bit of time nurturing class conciousness if I want a welfare state</p>
<p>I do have quite a bit of authority to throw at my one state since my country is so tiny and reactionary though</p>
<p>so I issue a decree to force slightly improved conditions for the poor</p>
<p>it isn't quite 'nobody starves', more like 'nobody super-starves'</p>
<p>our population is back down to 23.8k because of emigration</p>
<p>I'm shedding people like crazy due to this turmoil</p>
<p>Apparently they are going to Brandenburg, Mecklenburg... and Thüringia</p>
<p>I'm not generating extra SoL per se</p>
<p>Just forcing certain minimums</p>
<p>Oh boy, there's a war</p>
<p>France vs Britain, Spain, Netherlands and a lot of other people</p>
<p>Apparently France is trying to puppet Spain (the AI is very aggressive in the current build, this is going to be revised down the line)</p>
<p>France has lost half a million people so far</p>
<p>this was perhaps not the best thing they've ever done</p>
<p>Well, on the bright side, we're down to just 4k radicals!</p>
<p>And our standard of living is back above starving</p>
<p>I call this intense progress</p>
<p>I do kind of hope Prussia gets into a bad war tbh</p>
<p>as that could mean lots of migrants for me</p>
<p>just so long as I don't get invaded</p>
<p>I need to AFK briefly, then I will show you my country panel (not going to screenshot other than that though)</p>
<p>I return, and I bring with me the Coal Mining Miracle</p>

<h4>AAR : Papal States - Pt.1 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>Today we're playing PRESTIGIOUS POPE</p>
<p>We're gonna become a great power through the power of ART</p>
<p>Balance and AI are very not final, so I really can't say if this will be viable in the final game. Haven't done this in a while so actually not sure if it's viable now, but we're gonna try</p>
<p>So, the Papal States. We are, shockingly, an autocratic theocracy with very conservative laws. We accept both Italian cultures and there are no significant minorities in the country, either cultural or religious. There is a small Jewish population but it's unlikely to ever be politically relevant.</p>
<p>Taking a look at our economy, it is very definitely pre-industrial. There's a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>Art academies are expensive and we're not going to be able to afford them with our tiny economy that raises most of its money through taxes on the peasantry</p>
<p>We're currently 2.9k in the green. Max peasant taxes would only give us another 2k</p>
<p>I don't think peasant taxes are the way to go.</p>
<p>We have our own market. Certain luxury goods are very expensive but for the most part people have what they need</p>
<p>We do have a shortage of Clippers though. I'll just buy them</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Velstrom</strong></p>
<p>Nah, fund those clipper factories. They should still be relevant in a fewd decades</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll definitely want to become self-sufficient in the shipbuilding industry later, but I don't think it's gonna be my first move</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captaincat</strong></p>
<p>can the papacy form italy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>I think the first law we're going to want to pass is Religious Schools. We want more Literacy, so people will be qualified more the more specialized jobs we'll need going forward. I would ideally like to reform my tax laws but there's just no support for it right now</p>
<p>To support these schools I'll need a lot of Bureaucracy, so I'll build Government Administrations in Rome</p>
<p>I took a look at my fisheries</p>
<p>They were using the Simple Fishing PM, but since we've just started importing Clippers and we're buying more than we need, I've switched them over to Fishing Trawlers</p>
<p>This has quite substantially reduced the price of fish, since we're producing a lot more</p>
<p>This is basically a good thing, because fish was really quite expensive before</p>
<p>The profitability of the buildings is about the same. The price of their outputs is lower and the cost of their inputs is higher, but the increased output makes up for it.</p>
<p>Oddly enough there's also a significant demand for wine</p>
<p>So I guess my opening moves will be to provide the miracle of fish and wine</p>
<p>Oh I see why demand for wine is so high</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Papal%20States%20-%20Pt.1%20-/0368946dc73b290b-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Papal%20States%20-%20Pt.1%20-/0368946dc73b290b-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Obsessions: Wine</font></p>
<p>I'll expand the wheat farms in Romagna, which are using the Vineyards PM</p>
<p>With all this construction, wood is getting kind of expensive. I'll start a logging industry in Umbria</p>
<p>We're now in a deficit, but I'm not too concerned</p>
<p>Oh hey our fisheries just got more profitable. Egypt is now buying our fish.</p>
<p>Meat is also expensive, and I could potentially solve that by using Butchering Tools in my Livestock Ranches. But this would cause an input shortage of Tools, so I'll need to wait until I get Tools Workshops going.</p>
<p>Or I guess I could import Tools for now. Might as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>how easy is this info found? at the point of making the decision?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get an overview of your market in the market view, or you can see more details about particular industries in the building panel</p>
<p>Alright I've imported Tools, so I switched everything over to Butchering Tools. This still left us with with a lot of tools, so I switched my Logging Camps in Lazio over to Sawmills, which reduced the price of wood and therefore the state's construction expenses (edited)</p>
<p>Main market issues now are the high prices of glass and fabric. These will be solvable later, for now I'll live with it</p>
<p>I'm researching Lathe for now, since it's on the way towards Railways which are universally useful. If I had a lot of Universities I'd instead be rushing art techs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@CaptainChiffre</strong></p>
<p>Is glass needed for wine (and liquors) production, or is the need for bottles etc. abstracted in a pop need for glass (since pops need glasswares anyway, right)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah it's a pop need rather than a building need. Also the high price of glass in my market is mostly due to French and Sicilian export routes. This makes my glass industry very profitable but my pops are struggling to afford glass.</p>
<p>We could really use some more money... tempted to impose a consumption tax</p>
<p>I'm gonna take the risk - I'm taxing grain</p>
<p>The budget is now almost exactly balanced</p>
<p>And I can increase this tax if needed</p>
<p>Romagna has expanded its vineyards. I think the next thing I want to do there is expand the Textile Mills. This is an urban building which employs Shopkeepers and Laborers, which shifts pops to IG's I'd prefer better than farms. Clothes are also quite expensive.</p>
<p>In Umbria I'm actually going to go in the opposite direction and build a Cotton Plantation. Always need more Fabric and as a relatively small nation we have the capacity to be self-sufficient</p>
<p>It's treated like an autocracy, so a new leader is generated at random</p>
<p>Umbria's new Logging Camps are doing a lot of work. Price of wood is now quite reasonable</p>
<p>They also employ Capitalists, which is nice</p>
<p>The Industrialist IG is not get relevant in the country, but some day it will be</p>
<p>This is probably not an optimal move, but I'm going to expand my Arts Academy in Rome</p>
<p>Also with the completion of the Government Administration, the price of paper has risen significantly</p>
<p>It is a significant drain on the budget however</p>
<p>Actually I've changed my mind. I'll build a University</p>
<p>Price of Furniture is really high as well. I'll make a factory in Romagna</p>
<p>University is done. I think I'll finally address the Glass issue</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@CaptainChiffre</strong></p>
<p>An hour into the game, how much time has passed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About 18 months</p>
<p>I think it's time to attempt Tools self-sufficiency</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Slijmerig</strong></p>
<p>does your new uni provide any prestige compared to that art academy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, Universities just provide Innovation</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Volgabond</strong></p>
<p>any developments in the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only major war seems to be a dispute over Kazakhstan involving Russia and China.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Torch Wielding Hollow</strong></p>
<p>are you planning to try and unify italy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really, but if I can grab any Italian minors peacefully I will</p>
<p>The gold reserve is running out. Might want to pause expansion for a while.</p>
<p>Either that or I need a new source of revenue</p>
<p>I could tax grain AND fish</p>
<p>My law is taking forever to pass. I would really like my Literacy Rate to be better than 16%</p>
<p>hmm. yes.</p>

<p>I hope their radicalism stays low</p>
<p>Because I do not have the ability to appease these people</p>
<p>Oh, good news! Modena has asked us for an Alliance</p>
<p>I have a tooling workshop now, but its productivity isn't amazing. I could improve it with Pig Iron Tools, but I'd need Iron for that. Umbria has some potential for iron mining so I'll add it to thw queue. In the meantime I'll continue relying on tools imports to some extent</p>
<p>One big downside of being in our own market is that our land is not at all mineral-rich. Or resource-abundant in general. The only thing we really have going for us is that there's a lot of sulfur in Romagna, but that's a mid-game thing and not something I can exploit right now.</p>
<p>I'd prefer to remain in my own market for this playthrough</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bruno Carvalho</strong></p>
<p>Or get the other italian minors INTO your market</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd love to, and I'm slowly working towards it</p>
<p>Modena would join my customs union, but as their entire country is part of a split state in which Parma is the largest state, they're locked into Parma's market and can't accept my offer.</p>
<p>Alright new economic policy: we only build in 2 states at once. This just barely keeps the budget in the green</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Adrez</strong></p>
<p>Is any other italian state pushing towards unification alredy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that I can tell, but it's early for that</p>
<p>Austria is on fire</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>What happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They tried to conquer Switzerland</p>
<p>Vienna is now a Bavarian city</p>
<p>But also Zurich is Austrian. There was some back and forth in the negotiation.</p>
<p>There a little devastation fires all over Central Europe, with a little island of perfect calm around Munich. The Bavarians really trashed the place</p>
<p>Time for more Arts Academies</p>
<p>Two Sicilies is way ahead of us in Prestige</p>
<p>They had Prussian help</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bruno Carvalho</strong></p>
<p>Hmm how hard it would be to become the Pope Islands and conquer every mediterranean island?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty hard</p>
<p>You can not</p>
<p>Russia and China are still going at it, with neither side really gaining ground (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Andwé</strong></p>
<p>How's the Popeistan in terms of tech?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not great. Way behind Britain.</p>
<p>We at least have a level 1 university now</p>
<p>There's no such thing as exclusive tech</p>
<p>The tools plan worked out really well. With the new iron mine in Umbria, I'm able to switch to Pig Iron Tools in Romagna's Tooling Workshops. The price of both Tools and Iron has stabilized nicely.</p>
<p>And this is after cancelling imports. Great success.</p>
<p>We're now in late 1838</p>
<p>For reasons that aren't immediately clear, a lot of South Italians are migrating to Algiers</p>
<p>hmm... I have a choice between some very tempting options after expanding my Arts Academies. I can either significantly increase its throughput, or get a major head start on Realism tech.</p>
<p>That's more than a year of research at my current rate</p>
<p>I think I'll take the tech. Throughput is nice but I'm not in the running for great power yet.</p>
<p>Once we finally pass religious schools I think we'll want a new government that will pass tax reforms. Expenses keep increasing and there are only so many new taxes I can impose</p>
<p>We have no fleet</p>
<p>Our foreign policy is "hope nobody attacks us, and if they do hope that someone protects us"</p>
<p>Excellent news! Parma has asked for an Alliance, which improved relations enough that they joined our Customs Union. Due to the way split states work, this puts Parma, Modena, and Lucca in the Papal Market</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Green line go up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really. They don't really bring anything to the Market at all besides just enough food to feed themselves. It's had very little impact. My main reason to include them in my Customs Union is that it's a prelude to unification</p>
<p>Our economic laws are... really bad. Traditionalism, levying, no income taxes...</p>
<p>I really want to enact an Income Tax law, but I'm blocked by having Traditionalism. I don't have 10 years to try to pass both laws, the economy can't survive the wait. Instead I have to take the next best option - replace Levying with a Per Capita tax. It won't bring anywhere near as much revenue as an Income Tax, but it'll balance the budget.</p>

<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Can't you just change them since youre an absolute monarchy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not how laws work</p>
<p>Oh but that reminds me... I can use my autocratic powers here</p>
<p>I'll promote the Armed Forces and have the Pope personally support them</p>
<p>They're also in government now</p>
<p>The Armed Forces strongly support my tax reforms</p>
<p>I might even want to increase army salaries to increase their wealth, and therefore political strength</p>
<p>Yes, they become more powerful</p>
<p>I'm cancelling my Decrees to improve my Authority as well. I want this law passed.</p>
<p>Early 1839</p>
<p>It'll take about a year for the next chance to pass my tax law. Chance to pass is quite low, but it'll build up over several attempts.</p>
<p>There's no chance for the law to Stall, the opposition isn't powerful</p>
<p>It's opposed only by the Roman Landowners, who have been declining in influence since the start of the game due to my industrial buildup</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captaincat</strong></p>
<p>How’s your relations with the ottomans btw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are entirely disinterested in one another</p>
<p>Oh the Italian minors joining my market is finally having an impact</p>
<p>They've mostly specialized their economy for groceries production, which is increasing Standard of Living. It offsets some of the impact of my grain tax.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Which Italian nations still aren't in your market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tuscany, Sardinia, and Two Sicilies aren't in</p>
<p>Some unforeseen positive consequences. I added the Rural Folk to the government because they support moving the tax burden away from the peasantry. Because they are happy, they're providing a nationwide throughput bonus to agriculture and logging, which is what I was using my Decrees for. So that's nice.</p>
<p>Oh, I just noticed something. Rome has a pretty good capacity for Silk production.</p>
<p>Definitely would have been viable to have a totally different economic strategy than what I went for. Selling luxury clothes and furniture to the world is profitable.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On average, people are Impoverished. Which is a bit better than the global average</p>

<p>Not sure what the name change would be actually</p>
<p>Alright it's gonna take over 2 years but I'm researching Realism. We will have the world's fanciest and most expensive art</p>

<p>I don't see any reason to remove the Pope in this playthrough</p>
<p>I want to pass reforms that give me the money to fund my art, but I'm not interested in changing society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Adrez</strong></p>
<p>Art gives prestige right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I want to become a Great Power</p>
<p>Realist Art would actually bump me all the way to Major Power</p>
<p>Oh. I expanded my Arts Academies a bit more. We are now a Major Power!</p>

<p>I passed the law but left the institution at level 1</p>
<p>I have enough bureaucracy for 1 more level</p>
<p>I'll probably want more government administrations to get that higher later. But that costs money I don't have because I don't have my tax reform yet</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Why is it taking so long to reform your taxation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's not that much support for it and government legitimacy is not especially high</p>
<p>Opposition to the law is weak but lack of support slows everything down</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Do you need GP to form Italy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, but being at least Major helps a lot</p>
<p>You can do it as an Insignificant Power if you manage to conquer everything militarily</p>
<p>I'll want to research Nationalism soon I guess</p>
<p>I think in this playthrough I won't go for full unification. Just the Central Italian countries that will probably join peacefully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ezno</strong></p>
<p>Wait can you just partially unify Italy?</p>

<p>Yes, nobody is forcing you to complete the unification</p>
<p>It won't give me enough states to press the Form Italy button</p>

<p>Nah I'll probably not go that route</p>

<p>You don't need tech for silk plantations</p>
<p>We now have Realism. I have updated my Arts Academies PM and we're now the 11th most prestigious country in the world</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>How far away from gp?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to almost double our prestige. But this is quite achievable, if we can raise the funds for more Arts Academies</p>
<p>Still haven't passed the tax reform</p>
<p>oh dear...</p>
<p>United Sovereign Archduchy has entered the world</p>
<p>Interesting. I reformed my government, and my next law will pass in the year 100,000AD</p>
<p>Oh, I see the source of my legitimacy issues. I need the autocrat supporting an IG in government, because that's how legitimacy is derived in my government form</p>
<p>Right now I've set up an Industrialist government to move us away from a Traditionalist economy</p>
<p>No, they're not really very useful right now</p>
<p>I think that's enough AAR for today. Might continue tomorrow.Things are looking pretty good though. I have at least some money with which to expand my Arts Academies, things are stable internally (largely due to not doing anything to rock the boat), and nobody decided to attack us. We're on track for unifying central Italy too.</p>

<h4>AAR : Papal States - Pt.2 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>PRESTIGIOUS POPE continues here</p>
<p>I've played a little more without updating so here's a quick summary:
With our increase in power rank and continued efforts to improve relations, Tuscany has finally agreed to enter our Customs Union. Their economy is much more developed than the minor countries currently in our market - they produce a lot of clothes, including luxury clothes as they have their own Silk Plantations. They also bring with them a hugely better source of Iron, as well as yet more potential for Sulphur mining. They even have their own University.
I have continued to expand our Arts Academies, to the point that the national budget can barely afford the cost even with our new Per Capita Tax laws. I did this to pursue a [REDACTED] that made Rome the center of the Realist Movement, greatly improving the throughput of the Academies and therefore our Prestige</p>
<p>You know what, I'll be nice and give you a screenshot</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: The Arts Academy of Lazio has become a major center of the Realist movement, producing some of the finest works of our generation. Realism depicts the world as it is warts and all,rather than the world as we might like it to be: It seeks not only to be true to how objects appear to the eye, but also to be true to the everyday experiences of ordinary people: Papal States gets Supportingthe Realist Movement for 5 years Finally, art we can all relate to. +25.0% Arts Academy building Throughput</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>That's powerful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very powerful, though it has brought the national budget to its breaking point to achieve this</p>
<p>We are on the precipice of greatness</p>
<p>The 9th most prestigious country in the world, we only need to jump up 1 more spot to become a Great Power</p>
<p>Oh the Academy hasn't even fully employed since I expanded it</p>
<p>Victory</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Power Rank Changed We are now Great Power</font></p>
<p>Papal States Great Power in 1844</p>
<p>I don't think we're quite done yet though. I want to see my semi-unification plan through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mr.Erik</strong></p>
<p>that sounds broken</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah we'll definitely want to balance this some more. Though worth baring in mind that I devoted pretty much the entire national budget of a mid-sized nation to nothing but the production of art in order to achieve this. My Great Power rank isn't worth the ink it's printed on due to my utter lack of military or even economic power.</p>
<p>I'm a GP in name only</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>But you are still a gp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p>I'm now going to continue to stretch the budget by expanding my University</p>
<p>Which I'm doing so I can research Nationalism faster</p>
<p>Just got a Trade Agreement with France</p>
<p>This is quite nice since France was already my go-to trading partner. And it helps improve relations further, so with any luck France would help us out in a conflict</p>
<p>This is highly economically and diplomatically beneficial</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@ilmatar</strong></p>
<p>both sicilies might agree to join the market now with GP status. And then just a single Italy declaration away from forming a realistic italy (lol)</p>

<p>Yeah..... no</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Two Sicilies views Papal States as in need of their protection in geopolitical affairs. They are to intervene on our in Diplomatic Plays and may offer Papal States to become their Subject: likely side</font></p>
<p>Two Sicilies is a power in their own right, and they (correctly) see themselves as the stronger nation</p>
<p>If I can ever get my economy fixed I could build an army to conquer them or something, but that's a very long way off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>Is it time to build military to protect this GP status then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With what money? Art is REALLY expensive!</p>
<p>We finally have a University worthy of some sort of renown.</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Papal%20States%20-%20Pt.2%20-/8403df883cab6b62-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Papal%20States%20-%20Pt.2%20-/8403df883cab6b62-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: The Pope himself has officially opened the University of Lazio. Academia is beginning to flourish in Papal States</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>Is University of Oxford already in the GB market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Oxford and Cambridge are hugely more advanced Universities than Rome, unfortunately. GB is way ahead in the tech game.</p>
<p>Between the two, they have 10 level of university in Britain. I have 2</p>
<p>At least Britain hasn't discovered Dialectics yet, else their Universities would be supercharged</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>Research dialectics meta confirmed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researching the capacity for faster research is always going to be an appealing prospect. But like everything else there's opportunity cost.</p>
<p>For reasons I'm not entirely sure about, Umbria has just about the highest standard of living in Europe</p>
<p>I usually look at Paris for a SoL benchmark, but something seems to have gone wrong over there. People are starving in Paris.</p>
<p>That's... odd. AI France has shut down all industry in Paris except for a massive furniture industry that churns out inexpensive luxury chairs</p>
<p>While that does improve average SoL due to cheap pop demands, the people working in those factories are not well paid due to supply greatly eclipsing demand</p>
<p>And since everyone in Paris works in the furniture industry, it is a very poor city</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>Maybe France wanted to sell you fancy chairs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've actually begun to make my own fancy chairs. Between Rome and Tuscany, silk is vaguely affordable in the Roman Market now.</p>
<p>Only vaguely though. Now that I have the Academies, Universities, and Administrations that I needed in Rome I'll start expanding the Silk Plantations to make my luxury goods industries more viable</p>
<p>As an aside, the current law I'm trying to pass is Agrarianism. This isn't a great law for my purposes either but it beats Traditionalism, and unlocks better tax laws. Economic reform is a very slow process, since I haven't been focusing on major social change that would make faster reform possible.</p>
<p>Looking overseas, the United Sovereign Archduchy, led by Emperor Mason Worland, describes itself as a Constitutional Empire. Its leading Interest Group is the Petite Bourgeoise.</p>
<p>Japan seems to be having a civil war. Both sides are led by members of the Tokugawa clan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>BANKROLL THEM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two problems with that. 1) I have not invented Central Banking. 2) I have no money, art is expensive!</p>
<p>The Literacy Rate is much better now, but still pretty terrible. 34.5%</p>
<p>I'm not sure that our current education system will push literacy much higher than what it is now</p>
<p>Unlike in previous builds, you can now invest in Religious Schools up to max level. But I'm capped at 3 due to my Child Labour laws</p>
<p>And there's really no support for banning child labour</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Kinemod - Game doesn't exist</strong></p>
<p>Wait what are you doing to the children</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably they work in the Silk Plantations. Or maybe they're all apprentices to our world-renowned artists.</p>
<p>The price of Silk just will not stabilize. I keep making more, but that just encourages other countries to buy it, when I'd prefer it remain within my market. My economic laws do not allow me to restrict exports.</p>
<p>So I can run my luxury goods industries but their input costs are fairly expensive. They're not as efficient as they could be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>Would agraniasim help with restricting exports?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only Luxury Goods, unfortunately. I think I'd need Mercantilism to have the control I want.</p>
<p>Oh or Command Economy, but that's entirely beyond my reach</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@ErChick3n</strong></p>
<p>what year is it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's 1845</p>
<p>We have Mass Communication, which means we can finally start researching Nationalism</p>
<p>The Capitalists who run my one and only Luxury Furniture factory are insanely wealthy.</p>

<p>huh. Hadn't been keeping track of my IG's for a while. Turns out that if you orient and entire nation towards art production, the academic types who make the art and run the universities become quite powerful</p>
<p>There are... liberals everywhere</p>
<p>If the liberals start any political movements I'd be pretty open to giving them what they want. Though I will not cave on the Theocracy law. We're sticking with the Pope</p>
<p>For now the only active movements are to install a monarchy for some reason, and to preserve our terrible Traditionalism law</p>
<p>Neither movement is popular or radical</p>
<p>Downside of my Trade Agreement with France: they can buy my silk more easily</p>

<p>Absolutely!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@BOBA THICC</strong></p>
<p>When will the Agraism Reform pass?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could be years. It's painfully slow.</p>
<p>And Agrarianism is only something I'm doing to unlock better tax laws, which will themselves take a long time to pass.</p>
<p>Wow Emperor Mason stands no chance at all. Which makes sense, the republicans seized nearly all the actually developed states, except for like New York</p>
<p>Italians demand more wine. Building more vineyards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Kinemod - Game doesn't exist</strong></p>

<p>It will not go well for him</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Prymalfire</strong></p>
<p>Are there foreign powers involved in the civil war?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great Britain supports the Empire</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Great Britain supports the Empire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they don't seem to be actually lending much of a hand</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@ErChick3n</strong></p>
<p>what's your market like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things are mostly within global averages, with some exceptions. Wine is very expensive. Luxury Clothes are cheaper than rags.</p>
<p>Actually I should really fix that</p>
<p>I'll export them</p>
<p>Alright I've sold a bunch of Luxury Clothes to France. The price is now reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@𝓖𝓝𝓲𝓬𝓴 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓖𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓽</strong></p>
<p>Reasonable as going down or going up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going up. There's no sense in having really cheap luxuries. The pops who actually need them can afford to pay more, and the people producing the luxuries aren't paid well if supply eclipses demand.</p>
<p>That's odd. Both Bavaria and Belgium are having revolutions that appear to be peasant revolts.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Same 3 I started with</p>
<p>But Nationalism will hopefully give me a couple more</p>
<p>The United States of America has been restored. The Emperor has been deposed.</p>
<p>The new Republic is led by a very powerful Intelligentsia, with support from the surprisingly relevant Trade Unions.</p>
<p>So they're essentially progressive liberals</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Liam123</strong></p>
<p>what happened between the UK and USA</p>

<p>The war ended when the Emperor surrendered.</p>
<p>It's nearly Risorgimento time</p>
<p>The devastation of the American Civil War has left the restored Republic quite weak. I actually outrank them with my glorious art.</p>
<p>I'm actually very curious. I'm gonna check out American laws</p>
<p>The USA seems to have a lot of legacy laws from its time as an Empire. And it's trying to pass Migration Controls to appease the Trade Unions.</p>
<p>Slavery has not been abolished</p>
<p>This is is really really strange USA</p>

<p>We have Nationalism! It's partial unification time</p>

<p>We don't represent anarcho-capitalism in V3, only normal anarchism.</p>
<p>You can prevent movements from becoming radical enough to cause problems by not having radicals. Keep SoL high.</p>
<p>I mean, it's a very strategic game and thinking ahead to prevent problems before they happen is a lot more effective than trying to deal with a problem after it surfaces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>So panem et circensis is still a valid strategy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, though you can think of it in less cynical terms. If SoL is high, your system of government is actually working out for a lot of people and they won't be politically radicalized</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>is it easier to get a high SoL when you are more liberal or could I manage to stay the supreme autocrat of all russians without any parliament and all if I have enough ressources for the SoL?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but the process of achieving that economically is likely to empower people who will be inherently opposed to your regime</p>
<p>Early game autocracies can get a lot done, and can really get the ball rolling in terms of modernization. But later that modernization will create the means that overthrow the autocracy.</p>
<p>You can mitigate that limit with repression and brute force</p>
<p>Yeah that's basically how you have to run an autocracy as the game progresses</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>I might have got it wrong but I understood Daniel that way that a high SoL will allow my pops to think for themself which might end up in weird ideas that will result in radicals when I say no to those ideas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It more that wealth contributes to political strength, and different types of pops will gravitate to different IG's, and as lower stratas gain some measure of wealth they will empower IG's that will oppose autocracy</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>How can I go about Chinese style state capitalism?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercantilism and Outlawed Dissent</p>
<p>Yeah you can get Movements with or without radicals. A movement with very few radicals is toothless, unless you actually WANT the law they're proposing in which case you can leverage their support to get the law passed faster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>So if I want a different outcome I might get it by brutally opressing the very IG which idea I like in order for them to overthrow me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would really like to do an "accelerationist" run where I deliberately make things as bad as possible in the hopes that people will rise up against me and enact rapid reforms. That was part of what I wanted to do with the Russia AAR but it was cut short by a crash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Avian Overlord</strong></p>

<p>I did Liberalism in my Korea AAR, to some extent. Never really got around to democracy though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@wilcoxchar</strong></p>
<p>in a way the USA in the Papal States AAR managed to do an accelerationist run of sorts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure that a lot of progress was made there. All the revolution really achieved was restoring the pre-empire status quo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Avian Overlord</strong></p>
<p>Are authority movements glitched right now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, why do you ask?</p>
<p>Oh yeah there's a bug where it's possible to get a movement that wants to enact Chiefdom. Not a big deal, probably easy enough to fix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>Losing a war to the Sioux isn't accelerationism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it is if your true goal is to return America to its native inhabitants</p>
<p>USA in the Papacy game seems determined to destroy itself.</p>
<p>It's an absolute mess, things are still on fire from the civil war</p>
<p>In the hands of a player the USA is incredibly powerful. AI isn't done though.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>@Daniel "neondt" Tolman wow thank you for being so active and talking to us about the game :3 so I know like you have not talk about AI yet and Martin might do bad things to you but is there anything like super novel or new about it that is different from previous games?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm no AI programmer (or AI designer for that matter), so I'm not the best person to ask about this. I guess one massive difference compared to other PDS games is that the AI is not concerned with military micro, because it doesn't exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Avian Overlord</strong></p>
<p>(And as an American, having the US be an interesting run and not a total cakewalk is good too)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If everything goes smoothly, I think you only strictly need to fight 1-2 wars to achieve historical USA borders</p>
<p>Less if you can somehow get Mexico to give up in a diploplay for California etc</p>
<p>I didn't look at France's situation in depth but poverty was widespread across France.</p>
<p>I only identified the cause of poverty in Paris specifically, there must be something else happening on a national level</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@KingJulien22</strong></p>
<p>Expensive wars with Austria?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True, they were at war a lot. That was certainly a contributor, but not sure if it's a sufficient explanation. Never saw any part of France itself being occupied, so no devastation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bioiron</strong></p>
<p>what I'm saying is it doesn't seem like bad A.I. behavior if, for example, the ruling IGs pops had a higher standard of living even if it impoverished the poorest parts of france or even france as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily, though I didn't check the upper strata SoL specifically.</p>
<p>Input goods shortages weren't the cause, those would be really obvious and I probably would have caught that</p>
<p>Plus France is a great power with actual wealth and economic pull. They can easily solve problems like input shortages.</p>
<p>Definitely a combination of factors, but I wasn't able to identify them. It can actually be quite fun to try to work out why something is happening though.</p>
<p>Absolutely. The industrialists are chiefly concerned with passing laws that enrich capitalists rather than the whole population, for example</p>
<p>I do wonder what led to USA becoming a monarchy but it's probably too late to trace the causes of that</p>
<p>I'm quite surprised that France didn't have a revolution given the state of the country</p>
<p>Perhaps one is even brewing where I left things</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@NEF</strong></p>
<p>If I get the QA job, I’m gonna have fun breaking the system. I wanna see every pop over 60 wealth and at some point. lol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No sure how you'd achieve that. Goods would have to be insanely cheap, but for that to be the case the people making them would have terrible wages.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you're a tiny country that finds some way of generating incredible wealth, enough that you can just import absolutely everything? (edited)</p>
<p>But even with an import economy and cheap goods, where would actual wealth come from?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TotallyJazzed</strong></p>

<p>Despite my protests, Jersey isn't a tag in V3 yet</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dystopianist</strong></p>
<p>What’s the situation with the Sioux-American War? Is the Sioux abnormally powerful this game? Seems really interesting that they could somehow be pressing this much advantage over the US</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're not abnormally powerful, the USA is just incredibly weak due to a devastating civil war. The war ravaged the mid-west in particular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@s p i c e</strong></p>
<p>Would becoming a tax haven actually be a viable strategy for massive waves of immigration?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low taxes are one way of improving your SoL, so sure that can attract migrants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@NEF</strong></p>
<p>Dividend taxes perhaps? It’s a curious question. How do we fund all this? Maybe focus on producing an expensive good in Krakow that many people want?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem for Krakow is that they have nothing that can't be produced cheaper by someone else.</p>
<p>And they're locked into the Austrian market at the start</p>
<p>Japan can become very wealthy if you plan ahead well enough.</p>
<p>Another of the many interesting things about Japan is that luxury goods industries don't have export value, since you can't trade. So you've got all of this silk and probably some luxury industries, and hardly anyone to sell it to</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This means it's trivially easy to meet the needs of the upper strata, for the most part</p>
<p>But it also means that industries that would be big money makers in other countries aren't going to be very profitable in isolationist Japan</p>
<p>I think later on as Japan, I'd want to switch over to a Mercantilist economic policy. This would allow me to sell luxuries to other countries, and buy goods that I just can't produce in Japan like rubber and oil, whilst also keeping the economy relatively closed off through lots of embargoes (e.g. you can buy my luxury clothes but not my silk)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@s p i c e</strong></p>
<p>Are planned economies going to have to get carpal tunnel building infrastructure and railroads again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No more than any other economic policy. Buildings and infrastructure are always player-directed</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn't Japan be VERY dependent on its Merchant Navy, since it will later have to import lots of raw materials and food?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think it'll need a lot of food imports, Japan has a good amount of agricultural potential. Enough to feed itself at any rate. But if you're importing rubber and oil, those things are by that point critical to your economy, so yes you'll want to protect your trade</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bioiron</strong></p>
<p>ok, here is something I need to know, under free trade, do you pay for, like, tool workshop contruction with government money, investment pool money, or both?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It comes from the investment pool and building cash reserves if those things are available, and the remainder comes from the government</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Yes Rubber and Oil, but isnt Japan also dependent on Importing Metal ores? I only remember them having decent Coal deposits, but their Iron ore famously was not that good (Which is the main reason by they used folding for their blades)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their iron deposits are far from inexhaustible, but I haven't personally experienced an iron shortage as Japan. My PM's have been able to keep up with demand thus far, but I haven't played into late game with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Avian Overlord</strong></p>
<p>If you can tell me, how much can you mix ownership forms?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on your laws and techs</p>
<p>As Japan I strategically research production techs that unlock better PM's for raw materials so I can squeeze every last bit of productivity. Raw materials are the one thing you can't just endlessly build more of.</p>

<h4>AAR : Papal States - Pt.3 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>It's once again PRESTIGIOUS POPE time</p>
<p>Quick recap from last time: we've unified central Italy plus Lombardia, we have some semblance of a national budget despite our awful economic laws, and the world is generally on fire</p>
<p>Today's goal: Risorgimento. We're going to build an actual army and use it to unify all of Italy</p>
<p>As I noted yesterday, our integration of Lombardia gave us access to a very impressive Arms Industry, which produces cheap Artillery and Small Arms</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>All? I thought you were fine with partial reunification?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was, but then I achieved all my other goals</p>
<p>Looking at our Barracks in Rome, we're not using the most up to date production methods available.</p>
<p>So I've switched from Line Infantry to Skirmish Infantry, which require the additional good Ammunition as well as a greater proportion of Officers in the ranks</p>
<p>I don't currently produce Ammunition, but we don't need much so I've opened an Import route from France</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HideousPillow</strong></p>
<p>Do we still only have 5 battalions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After annexing more of Italy, we're now up to 35</p>
<p>I've also moved us over from Infantry Focus to Mobile Artillery. So we're now actually using cannons. This PM also inputs Tools, which is not ideal because tools are much more expensive than our super cheap military goods.</p>
<p>And in Barracks, the government has to buy all of the input goods and pay all employee wages</p>
<p>Armies, like art, are expensive</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>How big is the City of Rome ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its Urban Center is size 10. Compare to Paris at 15, and London at 50.</p>
<p>Typically Paris would be bigger by now, but AI France is having a bad day</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captain "Power BI" Nemo</strong></p>
<p>But prestigious?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armies are also prestigious! But much less so than art</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Whats the correlation between Urban centre Size and Population?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is none, urbanization comes from urban buildings. You could have millions of people in a state but no urban center at all.</p>
<p>No, one per state</p>
<p>Btw, Milan and Florence are both larger cities than Rome. both at size 12</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Btw, Milan and Florence are both larger cities than Rome. both at size 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we've very substantially increased our urban population by integrating central Italy</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>So we've very substantially increased our urban population by integrating central Italy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course this greatly affects the internal balance of power. Landowners are increasingly irrelevant, while the Petite Bourgeoise, Industrialists, and Intelligentsia are highly relevant</p>
<p>Updating our Production Methods has had a huge impact on the budget. Between salaries and military goods, we're down £10k</p>
<p>(salaries are higher because we're now paying more Officers instead of regular Soldiers) (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>deficit spending is fine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully we're still in the green, there's no deficit yet and we still have a small gold reserve</p>
<p>Taking a look at our military tech, things aren't great. Tech spread has generously given us a couple of tier 2 navy techs for our mighty armada of zero ships</p>
<p>We haven't focused on a single military tech the whole game</p>
<p>Our only tier 2 army tech is Logistics, which is actually a very important once because that unlocked Skirmish Infantry.</p>
<p>Right now I'm going to shift my research over to Percussion Caps. This will unlock Munitions Plants, so I can make my own ammo, and it'll also unlock Shrapnel Artillery for my Barracks.</p>
<p>I'll also expand my Barracks in Rome to allow another 5 battalions</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@DrawElements</strong></p>
<p>Is SSM allowed in Vic3 or is it like CK3?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>V3 doesn't have any representation of marriage at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<p>How are you financing these expansions of your military?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GDP, and therefore taxes, expanded a lot once I properly integrated central Italy</p>
<p>My GDP is £15m</p>
<p>Going to restart the game quick to fix a Garibaldi bug</p>
<p>Alright it's fixed</p>
<p>Garibaldi is an Artillery Master. He is an exceptional general</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>what was the bug about? if we can know of course</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a general he had politician traits and vice versa</p>
<p>I've given Garibaldi a promotion so he can lead more troops at once</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Is the Papal Army a National militia or are the warriors of God a profesional force?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good question. Let's check our laws</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yep. I could cancel the economic law but I really don't want to give up my progress there. However, after that I should actually be able to pass Professional Army quite quickly, as it has a lot of support.</p>
<p>Oh. Well this is a bug. Prussia formed Germany despite absolutely not meeting the requirements.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>St Petersburg is being occupied by Sweden</p>
<p>Oh thank god we have Organized Sports</p>
<p>Taking a look at my rivals in Sicily and Sardinia, they're using much less advanced Production Methods. We might not have quantity but we definitely have quality</p>
<p>We now have 40 regiments</p>
<p>Sicily has 50 and Sardinia has 37</p>
<p>We're greatly outnumbered</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>France alliance when?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I literally just received an offer!</p>
<p>Huh. Britain is in another civil war. The Petite Bourgeoisie want to restore the monarchy</p>
<p>France and Austria are going at it again</p>
<p>You know what, I doubt there's ever going to be a perfect moment to do this. The great powers are distracted at least. Let's pull the trigger on Sicily</p>
<p>I've started a diplomatic play</p>
<p>I've offered France a favor to join my side, even though they probably won't be able to commit much to the effort</p>
<p>The mighty armies of Wurttemberg are supporting Sicily</p>
<p>Austria declared neutrality, that's good</p>
<p>We finally enacted Agrarianism!!!</p>
<p>It only took about a decade</p>
<p>I've changed up the government. The army is now in charge, Garibaldi is the Prime Minister to the Pope.</p>
<p>We're passing Professional Army</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>so now are you a constitutional theocracy or still abolouty monarchy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We're still an autocratic theocracy</p>
<p>This play is definitely going to escalate to war</p>
<p>Sicily does not want to be annexed</p>
<p>Weirdly Sardinia is staying out of this despite actually being allied to Sicily. Though they are being occupied by Austria so that probably explains it</p>
<p>Garibaldi is mobilized. He's standing at the Sicilian border just waiting for the order to advance</p>
<p>Due to Austrian and Sardinian inactivity, we have both numbers and technology on our side, as well as an exceptional general. This ought to go well for us.</p>
<p>War time</p>
<p>A few battles have been fought. Neither side is advancing yet but we are tearing their army apart in casualties. They have no cannons at all, and we're using Mobile Artillery</p>
<p>Plus Garibaldi is an expert with these things</p>
<p>War's over. That was very fast. Massive casualties caused their line to collapse and we rolled over Naples with barely a fight</p>
<p>I think about 50k dead in total, mostly Sicilians</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>thats a lot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess that's what happens when you bring a gun to a cannon fight</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Vukma</strong></p>
<p>How much infamy did you incur?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It escalated. Now the Welsh want independence</p>
<p>My GDP has grown from £15 million to £22 million</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@SelfReferentialName</strong></p>
<p>is Austria even a GP at this point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically yes but its rank has dropped. If it can't get its rank back up soon it'll lose its GP status</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>So does Two Sicilly bring any interesting resources to the Papal Realm? Probably Sulfur</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of sulfur, yes. Also our only natural coal deposit though it's very small. They also bring the capacity for Sugar Plantations, which is not something we've had before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HideousPillow</strong></p>
<p>is sweden still in st petersburg? they were only occupying it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Swedes have gone home</p>
<p>The British Monarchy has been restored. This bodes poorly for the Welsh uprising</p>
<p>We also have access to the Sicilian Navy. It's just 10 ships but it's something</p>
<p>We have so much sulfur I don't even know what to do with it. I've put as much as I can into my Paper Mills</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>Can you use it for fertilizer. Stop the Americas from passing the guano islands act</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one of several uses of sulfur, but we don't really have the tech to do much with it right now</p>
<p>hahaha. Garibaldi has decided that he's a Theocrat now.</p>
<p>All hail the Pope I guess</p>
<blockquote>

<p>He cannot</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@𝕿𝖎𝖒</strong></p>
<p>Does the change in IG change the way he handles battles now aswell?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Garibaldi's political views do not affect his performance in battle</p>
<p>Building sugar plantations and coal mines, expanding iron mines and glassworks. I'm taking some time to improve the economy</p>
<p>In the meantime I'm improving relations with Venice</p>
<p>I'll probably start a play to annex Sardinia after I annex Venice peacefully</p>
<p>Just gonna speed 5 for a bit</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I need 2 more states</p>
<p>I've begun the diplomatic play to annex Sardinia</p>

<p>I have no idea why Austria isn't just getting a lot of separatist movements</p>
<p>The GP's have elected to stay out of this</p>
<p>Austria hasn't actually declared neutrality but I don't think they'll do anything. They're on the fence</p>

<p>The year in 1852. We are the #2 great power. The Pope's rule encompasses the entire Italian Peninsular, and the Roman Market extends as far as Normandy. Works of divinely-inspired art adorn every wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mppqlmd</strong></p>
<p>so in 16 years, you won 2 wars, diplo-annexed 4 countries, reformed your army and your entire economy, and got France into a custom union</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last part is definitely some kind of fluke caused by France's absolutely trash economy</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>So World conquest is very much possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Italian Unification is not representative of how quickly you can expand in general</p>
<p>I checked out the massive Roman Market out of curiosity. Incorporating France has caused total havoc. Untangling this mess would take years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>what do you even get for fixing the french economy, assuming you do do it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure I could find some way to make it work in the long run, but in the short term it's a gigantic headache.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nuukov</strong></p>
<p>How did France joining ruin it? I wonder when it comes to playing the game, what helps you make an informed decision on who to let into your market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can quite easily look at other country's markets and see what they're consuming and producing, and compare that to your own market. If you think they're a good match, a customs union might be favourable. (edited)</p>
<p>I accepted France into my market without much thought because I wasn't intending on continuing the game for much longer anyway</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>So, Sardinia first joined French market, then you annexed Sardinia, so French got lonely and joined you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sardinia was never in the French Market</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nuukov</strong></p>
<p>I want this, but I think they said that changing state religion is not possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's correct. Though I would like to make a decision for Japan specifically, to change state religion to Shinto.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>i dont think they are ready to unveil unrecognized countries gameplay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did a Korea AAR already (edited)</p>
<p>Not sure what I'll do next or when. There are a lot of things I'd like to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mitros</strong></p>
<p>Are markets still state based? or even if you have 2 countries in one state each get their own market? (i thought it was due for change?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A state region can only have 1 market. This is determined by which country has the largest state in the state region.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>I mean, can't I irritate Irish Catholics enough to make them force me go catholic ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irish Catholics don't want Britain to adopt Catholicism. They want Ireland to not be part of Britain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>can a country be in different markets at once?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of your states might not be in your national market if they're split states and another country has a larger state in that region</p>
<p>I'm just looking around the world, seeing how other countries are doing. Britain has 10 million radicals. Out of 25 million citizens. I am not surprised they're in constant civil wars.</p>
<p>The USA is completely bankrupt</p>
<p>Russia though is politically and economically stable. They got to #1 world power largely by not doing anything stupid while the world burned around them. (edited)</p>
<p>Tuva is ruled by a naked man, and has maxed out gold reserves</p>
<p>Italy is ruled by the Pope, everything that happened was divinely ordained</p>
<p>8000 Welsh people live on Corsica</p>
<p>More disconcertingly, a quarter of a million Dixie people live in Mysore</p>
<p>A consequence of America's poor fortunes I suppose</p>
<p>There was never a time when I was happy with the Papal economy, our laws were really bad and I wasn't able to reform them to any great extent. I just barely made things work with what I had.</p>
<p>It probably would have been better to put real effort into industrializing and building an economic base, which would have promoted the IG's I needed to do faster reforms. But instead I rushed Arts Academies.</p>
<p>Not really, I was a paper tiger. I did it because it was cool, not because it helped me</p>
<p>I didn't even have an army until after I became a GP</p>
<p>GP helps in all kinds of diplomatic ways, it's far from worthless but it was not the "optimal" use of my economic resources to devote the entire country to producing art</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@THE Skelly</strong></p>
<p>it's better to earn GP rather than game it. I like that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely true. You definitely can force it through art spam like I did, but being a GP in name only is not hugely beneficial. I was still economically and militarily weak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@One Proud Bavarian</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So then, what benefits do Rank confer? Generally, the higher a country’s Rank, the more Influence capacity it generates (allowing for a greater freedom in conducting diplomacy and signing diplomatic pacts), the more Declared Interests it can support (more on that next week) and the more Maneuvers it has in Diplomatic Plays (more on that in a few weeks). Rank also plays a key role in many other systems such as Subjects, Infamy, Diplomatic Actions and more, some of which we’ll get into in the coming weeks (I know I keep saying that, but bear with me, we’ve only just started on Diplomacy!).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It was certainly nice to be able to maintain improved relations with all of the Italians I wanted to integrate as well as the Great Powers who might make things difficult for me</p>
<p>Bordering Russia is not a chill game</p>
<p>Korea was very chill. Japan is maximum chill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@EnglishMobster</strong></p>
<p>Was Vicky ever restored as the Queen, btw?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, deposed monarchs are cast into the void never to return</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>is that possible in vic3?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Concerned_doggo</strong></p>
<p>I thought that stockpiles are still going to be in vic3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No stockpiles</p>
<p>Having played the game a lot I don't really see any need for stockpiling. The price model is extremely robust.</p>
<p>One thing I like about the price system is that it's essentially self-balancing. Stockpiles would throw a real spanner into the works.</p>
<p>Cash reserves are not a goods stockpile</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>does it not serve as one in a sense though, by buying goods that is currently in shortage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Cash reserves are mostly useful for expanding the building.</p>
<p>It's a lot cheaper to expand a building with a strong cash reserve</p>
<p>You might also be able to use the investment pool as well depending on your laws</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>this is a throughput penalty right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worse, it's an output penalty iirc</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>OOF, but that would mean you make less stuff for the same amount the input</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You also just can't buy the inputs you need</p>
<p>Basically if you have input goods shortages your building is temporarily ruined and you should fix it ASAP</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Trinexx (CK Community)</strong></p>
<p>please don't import arguments from outside the server</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have an input goods shortage in my drama factory</p>
<p>Abandon spheres of influence. Embrace customs union cubes.</p>
<p>All the micro in V3 is economic</p>
<p>Discussions of what is and isn't "mana" aren't very interesting or productive imo</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lain of the Wired - May Faction</strong></p>
<p>You think I truly believe provinces are mana?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think there's an limit to what strange things people are capable of believing</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@puer natura</strong></p>
<p>something is only mana if i consume it to cast magical abilities</p>

<p>I cast Road Maintenance</p>

<p>I'll take it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@NEF</strong></p>
<p>I’m guessing road maintenance improves state infrastructure nationally in return for a monetary cost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bureaucracy cost, which is a de facto money cost because bureaucracy comes from government administrations funded through the national budget</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Russ Kaunelainen</strong></p>
<p>"What if CK3 was a tabletop roleplaying game?"</p>

<p>It's D&amp;D but without the dungeons or the dragons</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@THE Skelly</strong></p>
<p>so heres an interesting question, what was everyones biggest takeaway from the Papal AAR?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Art is expensive</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ninjoe</strong></p>
<p>Though how much did art actually help in your game? It helped you get GP but did it help you more then other options?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It got me to Major Power which i needed to easily annex the minors. GP was more than I needed, I just pursued it for fun</p>
<p>The bordergore in southern Germany made a degree of sense honestly. South Germans were taking South German homelands that they were able to administer effectively.</p>
<p>What was less impressive was AI mismanagement of internal politics, but AI isn't done yet</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Brad</strong></p>
<p>motion for this discord to have access to the beta and stamp out AI wickedness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Denied</p>
<p>I really hope that the community doesn't develop a "meta" or play with the idea that there's an "optimal" path. V3 is a sandbox where you set your own goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@THE Skelly</strong></p>
<p>hey can we ban him? I dont like that he's right</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do it, he knows too much</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Volgabond</strong></p>
<p>i unironically love the "you have to utilize people skills in multiplayer" quote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has always been true in PDS competitive MP. Once you're competent at the game, it's 90% diplomacy and 10% military micro. V3 just cuts the military micro.</p>
<p>Agricultural exports definitely seem like a good way to get Haiti on its feet</p>
<p>You could even go a step further and manufacture groceries and liquor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@wwwalter</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you could start the USA-mexico war by starting a play for a mexican state and promising the USA northern mexico</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible, but I wouldn't rely on it</p>
<p>AAR is not a recognized development milestone at PDS, or hopefully anywhere else</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@deanodoc</strong></p>
<p>Becuase they will fire everyone post release</p>

<h4>AAR : Canada - Pt.1 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>CONFEDERATED CANADA starts here. Goals for this playthrough:
- Unite Canada
- Have a railway connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
- Pass the Multiculturalism law
- Pass Public Health Insurance and have maximum investment in Healthcare
- Remain a British subject</p>
<p>We're playing as Upper Canada, which would historically become the province of Ontario</p>
<p>We only have a single state, and it's not at all developed. Just a few farms, plus a coal mine and a sulphur mine.</p>
<p>Our tech is pretty damn good though, especially our Society tech. Often I'd be tempted to go straight for Railways, but the natural infrastructure of the region means we won't need that for quite a long time. Instead I'll beeline Nationalism.</p>
<p>I've kicked out the ruling Landowners, who have most of the country's political clout. I'm sure this will be fine. They're replaced with the only slightly relevant Industrialists and Intelligentsia. I'm going to do my best to industrialize and liberalize the country.</p>
<p>Right now, the law that serves my interests the most without risking a revolution is Poor Laws. This will provide a small amount of welfare while empowering the Industrialists.</p>
<p>We start out with Religious Schools. Eventually I'll want to switch them to Public Schools but for now this is fine. I'm immediately going to start expanding them. This will empower the Devout, which I'm not big fan of, but they're also not likely to oppose me either.</p>
<p>On to the national budget. I am very pleased to discover that we have Payroll Tax, an actual real tax law that doesn't rely on having millions of peasants. Most of the money goes towards maintaining the military. I'm not interested in war this session, so I'm just going to disband everything. This will drastically reduce both our expenses and the power of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>We're part of the British Market and we intend to remain there. This means we'll need to pay attention to market trends that we largely do not control and react to them.</p>
<p>One thing I immediately notice is the high price of Artillery. We may not need our own military force but we can certainly sell arms to our overlords.</p>
<p>So I'm starting out by creating an Arms Industry</p>
<p>Given that we're a OPM, another thing to keep in mind is that every building in the country has a significant impact on the balance of power. A single building that employs Capitalists will shift wealth and power to the Industrialists with far more impact than it would in a larger country, for example.</p>
<p>My now completed Arms Industries employ Engineers, Machinists, Laborers, and Shopkeepers</p>
<p>These Arms Industries are owned by the Merchant Guilds, which increases the employment of Shopkeepers in the building</p>
<p>When we have the Rifling technology we'll be able to switch o private ownership, which will employ more Capitalists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captain "Power BI" Nemo</strong></p>
<p>Which IGs do your Shopkeepers tend to support?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petite Bourgeoisie</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Petite Bourgeoisie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who I have no use for and may become very dangerous in the future. They're reactionary conservatives.</p>
<p>Now that my Arms Industries are fully employed I can see that they're making a tidy profit and enriching the people who work there. The price of Iron is causing input costs to be high, but thankfully the price of Cannons is even higher resulting in a profitable business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lion - (Political) Party Pooper</strong></p>
<p>How are the Landed Gentry taking getting booted out of government? Do you have a load of radicals now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were not thrilled, but they're not going to try to overthrow the government</p>
<p>I'm also seeing that Coal has become expensive in the British Market, so that's my next industry to expand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TotallyJazzed</strong></p>
<p>So what's the plan for confederation? Get Big Boy Britain to back you in all your plays?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all goes to plan I won't even need to start any plays</p>
<p>Because I'm using Atmospheric Engines in my Coal Mines, I'm able to activate the Private Ownership PM which employs Capitalists. I'm trying to shift wealth and power away from the Landowners any way I can.</p>
<p>So expanding my Coal Mines will not only increase my GDP and SoL, it will shift my internal politics in the direction I want.</p>
<p>Relations with Britain btw are very poor for historical reasons. We're working on improving them. We're also improving relations with our fellow Canadians</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@veluum</strong></p>
<p>What's your current SoL btw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very average</p>
<p>We're using the slowest construction method so building things takes a while, but it's also cheap. We basically break even in budgetary terms while we're constructing in Ontario</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lion - (Political) Party Pooper</strong></p>
<p>What are the accepted cultures of Upper Canada?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anglo-Canadian</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Anglo-Canadian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our Racial Segregation laws, we will accept any culture with European heritage</p>
<p>This unfortunately means that we discriminate against the Native American peoples whose land we live on. We'll try to address that later on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Glenmordor</strong></p>
<p>Can we use the sulfur to make any more valuable goods at the moment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not right now. But in the future I think we're likely to build some Chemical Plants</p>
<p>Coal continues to be expensive, so for now I'm just going to continue expanding my Coal Mines</p>
<p>Both the Industrialists and Intelligentsia are very happy with our government. The Industrialists are causing Capitalists to increase their contribution to the Investment Pool.</p>
<p>And with my Mercantilism law I can use the Investment Pool on almost anything that will generate profit.</p>
<p>Oh and the Intelligentsia are increasing my Migration Attraction.</p>
<p>I have plenty of Authority that I'm doing nothing with. I'll enact a Decree to increase the throughput of my mines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@L.L.</strong></p>
<p>Who wants to migrate into Canada at the moment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly other Canadians</p>
<p>Literacy is over 50% and rising. We're continuing to invest in Religious Schools</p>
<p>Due to my excessive micromanagement of the coal industry, our coal mines are the most productive in the world in terms of productivity per employee</p>
<p>Though certainly not in terms of raw output</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Staffordist Canadian</strong></p>
<p>Could you start attracting perhaps the Irish, take advantage of the future potato famine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've already attracted about 600 Irish to Ontario!</p>
<p>It's October 1837</p>
<p>The budget is looking REALLY good now. I'm going to try increasing construction speed.</p>
<p>Increasing construction speed creates a deficit, but we have plenty of gold reserves for now. I think I'll keep myself in deficit to grow my early economy.</p>
<p>Our GDP is a little higher than Lower Canada's. I need to be the largest Canadian economy for reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Glenmordor</strong></p>
<p>How much has GDP increased since the start of the game?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's almost doubled. This is because I started with essentially no productive industry, and now I have insanely productive coal mines. This seems like a big increase, but in the same way that double 1 is 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@L.L.</strong></p>
<p>There are some law you want to enact in the short term?</p>

<p>Poor Laws. Increase SoL very slightly, empowers the Industrialists.</p>
<p>I'm actually going to spend all of my Authority. This means I get no bonus to law enactment time at all. I'll be spending it on a Decree that increases my Migration Attraction even further. This is important because my population is low, and that could be a hard blocker on economic expansion.</p>
<p>For now, our low population means low bureaucracy cost for institutions. Our religious schools are so cheap to maintain that I don't even need a single government administration building.</p>

<p>We're very limited. Our coal mines are doing a lot of work for us now but we only have capacity for 11 in the state.</p>
<p>Ontario has the following natural resources, all at about the same capacity: coal, sulfur, wood. It has only 26 arable land, which I can use for livstock, wheat farms, and tobacco.</p>

<p>The era of Canadian lumberjacks begins</p>
<p>Our population is rising nicely. At 488k, starting at 450k</p>
<p>We're one of the most attractive states in the British Market</p>
<p>Our Logging Camps are at level 1. They're using Sawmills, which means we can use Private Ownership, employing yet more Capitalists. Even though it's slightly less profitable I'm producing Hardwood as well as regular wood, as this increases employment of Machinists over Laborers.</p>
<p>We have no universities so tech spread is a hugely more powerful force than directed research</p>
<p>£2 million GDP!</p>
<p>Number go up</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>And why employing machinist more benefical even if less profit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Machinists will support IG's I like. Laborers tend to not be very politically engaged</p>
<p>We're actually making so much money that I will reduce taxes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@gameing</strong></p>
<p>what IG do machinists support?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trade Unions usually. Eventually we'll need them to support some of the social democratic laws we want</p>
<p>Low taxes have a variety of effects. Obviously it means that people have more money so SoL will increase. But it also increases my Legitimacy, allowing me to e.g. pass laws faster. It also reduces the number of Radicals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>Aaaa make sense, i was wondering how do you want to do that with industrialist in power.</p>

<p>Yeah industrialist power is just the first step in my social reform plan</p>

<p>Famines would certainly create migration push but nothing I can do to artificially create one from Ontario</p>
<p>Oh dear. Th Anglican Church and the Petite Bourgeoisie have started a movement to enact Outlawed Dissent. I do not want this. They're radical enough that revolution is possible, but not enough that I think things will actually escalate that far.</p>
<p>After passing Private Health Insurance I think it might be time to separate church and state..</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MasterPaw</strong></p>
<p>Wont that make the church wanting even more to outlw aw dissent?</p>

<p>Yes. It will make them very angry for a while, but then it will make them very weak</p>
<p>Organized Sports!</p>
<p>Anyway back to the logging camps</p>
<p>We've got 2 level of university, enough for now I guess</p>
<p>The event for founding your first uni no longer gives you omnipotent philosopher-kings. Sad.</p>
<p>Oh we actually don't know how to separate church and state. We have not researched Empiricism</p>
<p>This is going to be unpopular and people will be radicalized but I need to break the power of the Church somehow. I'm enacting Public Schools</p>
<p>... actually no that is insane. It will definitely cause a revolution</p>
<p>Private schools turned out to be just as dangerous</p>
<p>I'll have to attack the church less directly</p>

<p>Keeping an eye on the British Market and adjusting for fluctuations to keep my industries profitable (edited)</p>
<p>I guess if I had to set new Canadian goals after I'm done I might try going communist or something. Trade Unions are getting stronger.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, but I'll probably volunteer</p>
<p>I think I got more coal in Ontario after annexing HBC. Because Ontario was a split state and HBC owned some of the more rural parts of the state region</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>
<p>i wonder if there is ever a reason to not just max your resource buildings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many reasons. Besides what Kadaeux said, its not always profitable to just spam raw materials.</p>
<p>In Ontario I had a lot of capacity for Sulfur Mines and I barely used any of it. There just wasn't enough demand to bother fully exploiting it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>
<p>but let's say it's 1880 and you're not really lacking the necessary pops or money&lt;, profitability is just not quite there, does it hurt to have a higher capacity than is currently in use?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it's definitely beneficial to produce more than you need - if you have other industries that use those materials and which are more important to you then it might be worth sacrificing the profitability of your raw materials industries. But if you're not personally profiting from manufactured goods (e.g. Ontario wasn't doing much with Coal) then that's not worthwhile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Kadaeux</strong></p>
<p>Dont upgraded/expanded buildings have higher maintenance of some kind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They require more inputs and employment. So you need to gauge what the right level of expansion is for your market conditions and goals</p>
<p>More isn't inherently better</p>

<p>IG leader can have various ideologies, but IG's fundamentally represent certain things. Intelligentsia are social liberals, PB are reactionaries, for example.</p>

<p>Discrimination is never beneficial to you. But it's supported by IG's that might be too powerful for you to oppose.</p>

<p>There's still time to de-confirm V3!</p>
<p>AI is super aggressive right now. Rate of economic development is basically where I'd like it to be, though AI is not super competent at developing their economies so it's easier to get an initial boom by finding gaps in the market.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you didn't change any military laws, you just removed the barracks buildings, right?</p>

<p>Yes exactly. Laws still have an impact on the Armed Forces strength even if I don't have any barracks</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>

<p>They had pop support</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>Hey neondt, do you know if there's any way to add "rider" nationalities to an ethnostate's culture list?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. That defeats the point of an ethnostate. It's not "ethnostate, but those guys specifically are okay"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Foke</strong></p>
<p>At what level is the differentiation? Will north-italian ethnostate discriminate against south-italians for example?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, unless you're the Pope and you have both primary cultures</p>
<p>Ethnostate is primary cultures only, no exceptions. If you want very close cultures to be accepted, don't be a fascist</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Alex "Alex" Hesseborn</strong></p>
<p>"no exceptions"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bioiron</strong></p>
<p>so wait is there only one primary culture?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on what country you're playing. But you don't ever get more than you start with except by forming a country.</p>
<p>Russia only has Russian primary culture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TotallyJazzed</strong></p>
<p>I don't think Scottish should be a primary culture if Welsh isn't</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not how the UK worked</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bioiron</strong></p>
<p>hmm, now I'm curious if yankee and dixie are both usa's primary cultures</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, USA treats both as primary</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lion - (Political) Party Pooper</strong></p>
<p>Ah I think I misinterpreted your AAR then. I'm guessing because Ukrainian and Belarusian as close to Russian culture they weren't discriminated, but they still aren't primary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's correct</p>
<p>Cultures have traits, rather than groups</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>Cultures can have multiple traits, then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Every culture has at least 2</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>What's the other trait for Bengali?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's Indo-Aryan Language or something like that. Indian cultures are split between that and Dravidian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>So there's always a geographic/racial and a linguistic trait? So Franco-Canadian would also have the Francophone trait?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's not always a linguistic trait, but often there is. Traits are added for the sake of creating plausible gameplay scenarios. For this reason Irish culture specifically does not have the Anglophone trait.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>Would it be possible to build an event chain to incorporate Ireland into the Anglophone world by giving Irish the Anglophone trait if Britain and Ireland meet certain prerequisites?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a feeling that cultures are static and cannot be modified in-game, but I am not 100% sure</p>
<p>Pretty sure it is not moddable</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ulf "UlfDerDritte" III</strong></p>
<p>I do hope that moddability/scripting concerning pops is more versatile in Vic3, so that you can for example turn all pops of X culture into Y culture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah that's do-able</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@tyrone</strong></p>
<p>It’d be cool to see a positive discrimination bonus to certain cultures in immigration policy</p>

<p>People who would be discriminated in your country aren't very likely to immigrate to it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Nils</strong></p>
<p>as it should be A big common market is a good idea but if your nation is rather dismal you will loose to your partners Hello EEC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Joining a customs union just to leech off a more developed market might see all of your pops deciding they'd rather live in those more developed states (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Doodlez - Fotp</strong></p>
<p>If my nation doesnt allow migration how does that interact with a shared market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Closing your borders is a solution to the above scenario. If you close your borders your pops can't leave</p>
<p>Korea begins with closed borders, so if it joins the Chinese Market there won't be any migration between those countries</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>If you close your borders, can you trade with the outside world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can still trade, it's not the same as economic isolationism</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Lion - (Political) Party Pooper</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>I’ve got a question, in the recent AARs, it seems the pace of the game was rather fast. Meaning countries climbed the ranks a lot in 20 years of gameplay and nations like Canada and Italy here able to form quickly as well. Is this working as designed or a result of WIP balancing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a very broad question and I'm not sure I can give a concise answer. If there's any aspect of the game in particular you'd like to ask about I can try to give a more targeted answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Russ Kaunelainen</strong></p>
<p>w/ reg. the earlier discussion on culture and language, clearly there should be separate in-game culture for Scots, Scottish Gaelic, and Scottish English. ;D</p>

<p>We might add Gaelic at some point, sure. It's not in yet though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Russ Kaunelainen</strong></p>
<p>Primary cultures, plural? That is definitely confirmed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, some countries have multiple primary cultures. USA has Yankee and Dixie. GB has English and Scottish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@ragno</strong></p>
<p>What about Italy? If Italy goes fascist, does it start discriminating against one of the two cultures?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you unify Italy you have both Italian cultures as primary and can never discriminate against either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Tritium</strong></p>
<p>Sorry if this has been answered already but is australian a culture? I recall a lot of 'colonial' cultures were just british in V2</p>

<p>Yes, Australian is a culture</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@GreenTaco</strong></p>
<p>I'm aware that she is, I was speaking specifically to a mod I could make, and if it would be possible, to make an event fire by the modable applications of game setting a ruler to specific years. I am asking if the ruler is modable, like in eu4 how you can "set a ruler" by event, like Charles V. I'm mostly wondering in the case like in the papal aar if you could make a mod that would allow for a "historic ruler" event to fire if the parameters were correct, so that random people don't take over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, you can do that</p>
<p>No, you can't add more primary cultures except by forming countries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>In the Papacy game, the Vatican United Italy and became the n2 great power after Britain in 1852. Is this in line with the game design or a result of wip balancing? To what extent will this result be possible in the release version of the game as you understand it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>How does it affect status right now? I assumed it would be like a max of 200% modified on gdp and army</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a GP absolutely doesn't have any impact on your GDP or military</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dan</strong></p>
<p>Sorry I meant the impact of prestige on your total score that decides GP status. I may need to reread those dev diaries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah right. You're correct then, prestige is impacted by your GDP and military strength among other things</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Doodlez - Fotp</strong></p>
<p>Do we know if being a GP even does anything for you beyond more Diplo capabilities? In Vicky 2 being a GP was vital to gameplay but both games are not necessarily comparable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a GP is a diplomatic thing in V3. Doesn't give you any magical economic or military powers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Vulpes</strong></p>
<p>it's probably worth noting that country formation in Europe is presumably a best possible showcase for the power of art spam, since it's such an enormously diplomatic game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but at a certain point you need an army. Notice that once I achieved my arbitrary GP goal I stopped building more arts academies and started building barracks</p>
<p>One mitigating factor is that I am quite good at the game. I'm on the team that makes it.</p>
<p>I've also deliberately picked goals for my AAR's that aren't super difficult for me to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Vulpes</strong></p>
<p>I accept that you're good at the game neondt but I'm worried we might get good at the game too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps when you get that good you'll want to turn up the difficulty then.</p>
<p>I exclusively play on Normal</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>
<p>It also sounds like a lot of your advantage is just being a bit ahead of the curve because you're min-maxing, which won't work as well for larger nations (which will need to generalize more) and will still only give a temporary advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true. The experience of playing larger nations is very different from playing smaller nations. I think people got a glimpse of that in my short Russia game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@tyrone</strong></p>
<p>did achieving your goal to become gp not give you any real benefits? like would have it been easier to just go for a military conquest of italy to unify it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It probably would have been easier and long-term better for me to achieve GP status through normal means. But I didn't want to use normal means, I wanted to be Art Pope</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HP L1908w</strong></p>
<p>Would you describe the game to be "hard" ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure. It took me quite a while to reach this level of understanding of the game. Now that I'm quite good I have a strong knowledge of which goals will require a level of engagement that is fun to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@gameing</strong></p>
<p>his papal aar would have seen a bigger opposition to unification from austria if it had not decided to commit sudoku</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most definitely. I'd expect to have Austria opposing my plays against Sardinia and Sicily - and indeed for those two to work together more effectively.</p>
<p>I would also have likely needed to confront Austria directly, as they were forced to release both Lombardy and Venice due to devastating military defeats</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@tyrone</strong></p>
<p>what do market leaders get as benefits btw</p>

<p>They get to determine who can join the market, or kick people out. There are also trade benefits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@tyrone</strong></p>
<p>why would someone want to kick people out of a market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe they're undercutting an industry I rely on. Maybe I want to attack them later and I don't want them benefiting from my market access. Maybe they're consuming goods that I need for myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mr.Erik</strong></p>
<p>maybe they are getting too much migration from my country</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That too</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Solid Scrooge</strong></p>
<p>Is it possible for gp markets to be combined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. GP France joined my market as GP Pope</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@wes</strong></p>
<p>Is world conquest feasible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say not if you're playing "normally". I'm sure someone will do it. I do not think they will have fun in the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MasterPaw</strong></p>
<p>I dont think its fun to WC in eu4 and yet people still do it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. But at least EU4 is basically about blobbing, I can see why people would bother to make the attempt even if the process is not fun.</p>
<p>All Popes will be Italian due to how ruler logic works</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HP L1908w</strong></p>
<p>So there is no DECLEARE WAR button in the game ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is not</p>
<p>Why would you want to declare war when you might get what you want without a fight?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HP L1908w</strong></p>
<p>War is an extension of diplomacy, right ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In V3 this is literally true</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@wes</strong></p>
<p>Is adding wargoals during a war possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, all wargoals are determined during the diplomatic play stage</p>

<h4>AAR : Canada - Pt.2 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>CONFEDERATED CANADA resumes here</p>
<p>Quick recap: last time we played as Upper Canada. We confederated with Quebec and the HBC, leaving us geographically large. We made a lot of money from coal, but the market is no longer as hungry for black gold as it once was and we've had to start diversifying - explosives seems to be a promising industry.</p>
<p>Incorporating the HBC has left us in a bit of a mess. We have a bureaucracy shortage, and the budget is in an extreme deficit. I'll need to investigate the and address the causes.</p>
<p>Looks like there's a university in Saskatchewan. As cool as this this I don't think we can really support that right now. Shutting it down.</p>
<p>We also really do not need naval bases</p>
<p>Although our bureaucracy shortage is small it results in more than 10% tax waste. We need to address this ASAP</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aldeéra</strong></p>
<p>Yes close the university, send the children to the coal mines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the topic of coal mines, we actually have more capacity for them now in Ontario. Ontario was a split state, with the other part being owned by the HBC. We can now expand up to level 18 in Ontario.</p>
<p>Likewise we also have more capacity for Iron in Quebec</p>
<p>Removing expensive buildings has mostly solved the budgetary crisis, but I've also had to reduce government wages to normal levels. Many of the luxuries of playing OPM Ontario are no longer viable, as we have a larger and poorer population to deal with.</p>
<p>One new positive thing: the trade unions are becoming ever more relevant, and they approve of our government (though they're not part of it). Their approval gives us 10% throughput in our manufacturing industries</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Jüstinyen</strong></p>
<p>yeah what particular reasons make the trade unions like the government right now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They like our set of laws, such as our republican form of government and the right of assembly</p>
<p>Our population is now at 2 million, with GDP rising to almost £8 million</p>
<p>Due to discrimination against the First Nations, Nunavut and Manitoba have issues with Turmoil.</p>
<p>We ought to address this. Thankfully I'm already in the process of researching Egalitarianism to unlock more progressive laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Jüstinyen</strong></p>
<p>maybe getting rid of the police was a bad idea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this playthrough I am aiming for a lighter touch. They're angry for good reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>How many Irish and how many French ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>132k Irish! The Irish population has grown dramatically, they're the 4th largest ethnic group in the country</p>
<p>We also have over 100k Finns</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@steam train</strong></p>
<p>Wow, any reasons in particular for the immigration spike?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've been encouraging immigration to Ontario for the whole game. With its very high standard of living, it is the most attractive state in the British Market</p>
<p>There's something making the turmoil worse. The Petite Bourgeoisie despises our government's policies, and their Xenophobia has been activated. This increases the number of radicals from discrimination.</p>
<p>SoL in Ontario remains very high, but it's been on the decline since the end of the coal boom</p>

<p>Shopkeepers mainly</p>
<p>And Clerks</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@prequel memer</strong></p>
<p>Out of the 2 million, how many are native people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About 200k, 10% of the population</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>Reeducate them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No</p>
<p>The Bureaucracy shortage is over, but with our expanding institutions, growing population, and need to build quickly we need more than an absence of a deficit. Building more administrations to give us a healthy surpluss</p>
<p>And with the budgetary crisis largely resolved I'm resuming the expansion of coal mines in Ontario, as well as the Logging Camps in Quebec</p>
<p>Oh I should also check out the potentials of my new states</p>
<p>Manitoba mostly has wood. Nothing special here.</p>
<p>Nunavut is... Nunavut</p>
<p>Northwest Territories have a bit of iron</p>
<p>Saskatchewan already has some food industries and a logging camp. I'm actually expanding government administration here as well. It also has the potential for 15 levels of coal mines</p>
<p>Saskatchewan is a fairly promising state</p>
<p>Alberta though... even better. More coal, more sulfur, more wood.</p>
<p>And finally the Yukon territory has a little wood and iron.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@CatalystNarco</strong></p>
<p>can you have more than 15 lvls if do some research?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, tech doesn't give you more levels. It unlocks PM's that can make your building much more efficient.</p>
<p>We're getting close to maxing out our healthcare institution investment. We need more bureaucracy to complete it though</p>
<p>Updating our PM's in the Food Industries we inherited. They're mildly profitable with Canneries and Sweeteners</p>
<p>We're also going to start using explosives in the iron mines. Price of iron is increasing</p>
<p>Blasting in the sulfur mines as well</p>
<p>The downside of these explosives is that it increases the Mortality of the people employed there. Mining is dangerous work.</p>
<p>We now have Egalitarianism</p>
<p>We've begun enacting Multiculturalism. The PB and Anglican Church absolutely hate this. They are threatening to start a revolution and overthrow the government. Despite being very angry, they are not actually very popular. I don't think they'll be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>I'm going to research Pharmaceuticals next. A lot of people work in the mines so a reduction to Mortality seems valuable</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Jüstinyen</strong></p>
<p>do you have an army to deal with at least the internal problems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not.</p>

<p>I'm kicking the Industrialists out of the government. They've served their purpose but we don't need them any more</p>
<p>The Intelligentsia's Radical Party rules alone</p>
<p>The population is growing at an alarming rate. I'm really struggling to keep up with the bureaucracy costs. I might have to scale back on institutions. For now I'm taking on more deficit to build administrations in Alberta and Saskatchewan</p>
<p>Due to massive amounts of migration to Canada, the population is approaching 3 million</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Cara</strong></p>
<p>Do you still have Decrees up?</p>

<p>I do actually</p>
<p>I could cancel the migration Decree, but the migration isn't just affecting Ontario any more</p>

<p>We'll begin with coal mines in Alberta</p>
<p>We have Pharmaceuticals. I'll research Central Banking next</p>
<p>Ontario will actually need a railway shortly. I'll queue one up</p>

<p>I'm cancelling the migration Decree. Population is up to 3.5 million and I can't keep up with the growth.</p>
<p>I'm a victim of my own success</p>

<p>I'll connect Montreal to the railway line once I'm done with the Motor Industry</p>
<p>We should be able to annex Columbia District in a few months</p>

<p>We're still going, but not much to say for now</p>

<p>Well, that took a while. Iron Confederacy has been fully integrated</p>

<h4>AAR : Canada - Intermission - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>I continued my Canada game for a while outside of the AAR format. In case people are interested, here's a summary of how things progressed. I faced two main obstacles. First was that the Industrialists I had spent most of the game building up are now my greatest opponents. Now that I want to start passing social democratic reforms, they oppose rather than support my laws. This became a problem when the labour movement kicked off and threatened a general strike if I didn't reform my Poor Laws into Wage Controls within a given period of time. Attempting to do this caused the Industrialists to threaten a revolution I wouldn't have been able to avoid. I just barely had time to pass Guaranteed Liberties (which lessens the risk of revolt if you invest in it sufficiently) and appease the Industrialists and then pass Wage Controls before the strike broke out. Now I have a powerful and angry Industrialist faction.</p>
<p>Second obstacle was economic. I really wanted to get my Hydroelectric Power Plants up and running, and to use start using electricity in some of my industries to increase their output. I especially wanted to use it in my Chemical Plants to increase the output of Explosives, which were nearing on a market shortage. Ontario actually has a state bonus to electricity generation due to Niagara Falls, and I was able to build quite a lot of power plants. Unfortunately my output was affected greatly by the labour strike, and my membership in the British Market came back to bite me. Mostly I've been producing raw and manufactured goods that British pops and buildings want to buy but which I have little use for within Canada. Electricity (at least in the current implementation) is just another market good, so all that I produced was available to the whole market immediately. This meant that I couldn't use it without creating a shortage, as Britain was using it all to refrigerate fish.</p>
<p>Yeah I do admit that the way electricity currently works is quite odd (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Also what year was it by the end of your session?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mid 1850's I think</p>
<p>Oh I also researched feminism. I got an event where I could appease the industrialists by having the trade union leader resign. The new leader was a feminist who will support Women's Suffrage. That'll probably be my next law. Only irrelevant IG's will even oppose it</p>
<p>Not sure it would work as a capacity</p>
<p>Capacities work best as slightly abstract things rather than tangible material outputs</p>
<p>I kinda liked the infrastructure idea</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@lawsome</strong></p>
<p>Would passing a law they like satisfy the Industrialists or do they make their evaluations of the government based on the laws as a whole, rather than whatever happened most recently?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing a law the industrialists like would have appeased them, but I didn't want to pass any of those laws</p>
<p>It's possible for a more populist feminist movement to happen but I'll likely pass Suffrage well before the triggers for that become valid</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Is there a possibility that you continue the save in an aar format?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible</p>
<p>For dinner today I have a full english breakfast. I really love mushrooms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>What is the problem  with electricity as good? Thats how modern grids work. Power plants selling and electricity companies buying, often from other countries if infrastructure allows it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's just a little odd that my hydroelectric plants in Ontario are being used to power fisheries in Ireland</p>
<p>Regardless of the oddities with electricity specifically, the situation does highlight one of the downsides of being part of a large market. Everyone has access to all the goods, so you can't just produce something and expect to have control over what happens to it.</p>
<p>My power plants were EXTREMELY profitable at least</p>
<p>Getting a head start on a brand new industry has a lot of benefits</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Viligans</strong></p>
<p>Could you keep expanding them to increase the supply and stabilize the price? I'm guessing that any new jobs in those power plants are going to be pretty juicy given the profit margin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. And that's the plan. But I've been hampered by the strikes, and I only resolved that situation near the end of my play session.</p>
<p>My power plants are also just not very efficient. Although you can build them with a tier 3 tech, they only really start outputting a lot of electricity with a tier 4 tech that adds coal as the primary input (edited)</p>
<p>And I'm a long way from being able to comfortably get tier 4 techs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Viligans</strong></p>
<p>Luckily you have a local coal market with supply?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I am the largest coal producer in the world now - I've maxed out every coal mine possible in Canada, using the most productive PM's I have available (which also helps with the price of explosives, making my chemical plants more profitable)</p>
<p>I think my current research is Dynamite, which will make my mines even more productive. Though I won't actually need to use that for a while. I produce so much coal that it's not especially expensive any more. Coal mines are still profitable and a huge contributor to my GDP, but they don't instantly enrich everyone who works there any more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>at this point, would rolling back on coal PMs be a good idea seeing as the market is no longer as coal hungry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so. Rolling back to older PM's would make my chemical plants less profitable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@lawsome</strong></p>
<p>Are you at market share size where you can reliably raise profits by just constraining the output?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes but as I said I think there are more downsides than benefits to that</p>
<p>There are definitely situations where you might want to artificially limit supply though</p>
<p>I am a little worried about what will happen to my economy once oil starts being used.</p>
<p>I'm very reliant on coal</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Captain "Power BI" Nemo</strong></p>
<p>Who currently controls Alaska?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still Russia</p>
<p>There's not been a lot of major border changes, especially in the Americas</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Basil</strong></p>
<p>Does Canada have oil deposits?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it has at least some? Not entirely sure</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>Time to conquer texas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think both USA and Mexico would have objections</p>
<p>also I still have no army</p>
<p>I'm suppressing internal revolts by making my society so free and democratic that pops prefer to use the established political process to voice concerns rather than taking to the streets</p>

<p>Those fools think that they can win elections and pass the reforms they like (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@NEF</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you could artificially increase the demand for coal by making more products that need coal such as steel?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually don't make Steel in Canada at all. I've never really investigated the viability of the industry in my market.</p>
<p>The collapse of the coal industry is a problem for future Daniel. And I hate that guy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@lawsome</strong></p>
<p>It does seem to undermine the "uncertain possibilities of elections" thing when the player can functionally prevent any law from passing except those that try outside-the-law means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's more that I know damn well that they're not going to win</p>
<p>The Mackenzie-union coalition is really strong</p>
<p>While the PB and Industrialists will not team up together to oppose me, at least for now</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@NEF</strong></p>
<p>You must protect our most profitable industry! What if it collapses and the people revolt due to lost SoL?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let them eat coal</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>can't you restrict the export of goods outside of your country? or does that just doesn't matter because you are a subject and in Britains market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah my membership in the British Market prevents me from having that control</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>Are we collapsing into liberal disasters like vic2 ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The liberals are the government so no</p>
<p>For now anyway. I'll probably kick Mackenzie out eventually and have a purely Trade Union government</p>
<p>But for now his IG is increasing our legitimacy even though he has no strong feelings one way or the other about the laws we're passing now</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Rookie</strong></p>
<p>In this timeline, would Karl Marx be Canadian?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, we were not the first to discover Socialism</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dr.Mundo</strong></p>
<p>so Canada is authoritarianism now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not at all. We're extremely progressive.</p>
<p>The more progressive we get the less authority we generate. I can barely even pass a single Decree now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>People who fail to catch-up with the progress are supressed I assume</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody is suppressed actually. People are free to advocate for whatever ideas they like. It's just that with so many people able to vote (hopefully including women soon), very few people are listening to dumb ideas like feudalism or racism.</p>
<p>More suffrage basically empowers the lower strata. Laborers typically don't care about politics, but with the franchise extended and literacy increasing, they're joining the Unions in droves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>More suffrage basically empowers the lower strata. Laborers typically don't care about politics, but with the franchise extended and literacy increasing, they're joining the Unions in droves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Unions have also been empowered by the fact that I caved in to all of their demands during strike negotiations. They're very popular and very successful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>Please don't go stalinistic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely not doing Stalinism in this run. Maybe council communism, who knows</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bioiron</strong></p>
<p>given that the trade unions seemed to be largely powered by immigrant pops, do they have any desire for migration control at all?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only the PB care about migration control. They're definitely a very relevant IG, but it's one of the reasons they don't get along with the Industrialists who really like the influx of cheap labour (edited)</p>
<p>I will say that's it's incredibly difficult to transition to communism peacefully. Council Republic is opposed by most IG's.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@The_Last.Satrap</strong></p>
<p>Is it actually possible for you to break free of Britain by paying reparations and then manipulate internal politics freely ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Britain doesn't care to manipulate my internal politics. I can go communist and they won't do anything but grumble</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Bioiron</strong></p>
<p>so the industrialists like the cheap labor that's empowered unions that have replaced them in coalition with the intellectuals in government</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Capitalism contains the seeds of its own destruction, apparently</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@TreeGuy</strong></p>
<p>Btw, can you leave the British market of your own volition?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I'd need to gain independence. And Britain will not let that happen without a fight</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Rookie</strong></p>
<p>If this happened to another major power, like for a crazy example Russia, would the other GPs care more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Harry Turtle Club</strong></p>
<p>Does this apply if there's a civil war or only if you switch to communism peacefully</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there was a civil war I would expect Britain to step in and support the anti-communist side</p>
<p>If I somehow do it peacefully, they have no right to intervene</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>can you do that? or it is hard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very hard. Nearly everyone will oppose it.</p>
<p>I'd need to engineer a situation where only the Trade Unions are powerful</p>
<p>For now I can't even pass the law. The labour movement wants labour rights rather than the abolition of capitalism atm</p>
<p>We know what socialism is but the Unions have yet to adopt it</p>
<p>Oh that reminds me. The Poor Laws were giving the Industrialists 30% more political power due to my high investment in it. Replacing it with Wage Controls has entirely removed that extra power.</p>
<p>The law also means that there is a national minimum wage</p>
<p>Don't remember. Mid-late 1850's</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You get nothing. So you just need to decide whether you care about the war goals</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Yojimbo</strong></p>
<p>Does Canada start off as like Hudson Bay company or am I making that up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It starts divided between several colonies including the HBC. I started as Upper Canada (Ontario)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>
<p>do you set the wage yourself or is that handled by  market forces  ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market forces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>that also means you can shirk the call right? join the war but does nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonies can drop out of wars called by their overlords for a relations penalty.</p>
<p>I'd rather drop out during the diploplay than technically join the war but do nothing</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@DustyAgent006</strong></p>
<p>I wanna play this and see how quickly I can destabilize the whole world with as small a country as possible. The Army of Chaos if you will</p>

<p>You can probably cause a lot of havoc</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>huh, why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't want anyone deciding that they can win the war by cutting off Britain's supply of coal</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>
<p>what's your army model anyway? National Militia?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peasant conscripts. But I have no army so it doesn't matter</p>
<p>I could raise military wages from 0 to 0 to appease the Armed Forces, who have 0 political strength and cannot participate in politics</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MasterPaw</strong></p>

<p>It's not an exploit because it has no advantages</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>Tbh realisticly if somebody dont have an army the IGs should revolt much much more easier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use Guaranteed Liberties to prevent revolts rather than suppression or force to fight against them</p>

<p>Dozens</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Baron</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, Anglo-Canadians are still easily the largest group. Franco-Canadians have clawed their way back to the #2 spot as well.</p>
<p>I haven't been keeping track but perhaps some pops are integrating</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>does Britain want to annex you for your resources?</p>

<p>No, it already has my resources</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>

<p>Identical build. There's a lot of variance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I can afford an army but I don't want one</p>
<p>Canada currently has only 4 non-marginal IG's, and I'd like to reduce rather than increase that number</p>
<p>There's the Intelligentsia and Unions on the government side, and the Industrialists and PB in the opposition</p>

<p>Yep. There are no laws at all giving them power, and their usual agricultural power base doesn't exist because we do not farm</p>

<p><strong>@Ads21</strong></p>
<p>Feels like there should be a bit more stickiness to the power and influence of IGs.

Pops aren't going to rapidly abandon their beliefs even if they are changed by circumstances over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People are still religious. But the political power of the organized state religion has entirely collapsed. Plus we have many faiths in Canada now. Huge numbers of people are Catholic, Jewish, or Orthodox</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>so the govemernt is secular? (edited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is now</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>
<p>but shouldn't the church still have influence over the people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, they lack their traditional power base and there are no laws arbitrarily propping them up. Nobody wants the Anglican Church to be politically relevant, so they're not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Aquos</strong></p>
<p>so they have no money and no one is helping them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have no money. Unlike say, the Industrialists who have a huge amount of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Laurin</strong></p>
<p>but coal miners aren't arbitrarily less religious than farmers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church is really not speaking to their material or social interests though. The Unions are.</p>

<p>A lot of the Yukon gold was depleted, which created a lot of radicals in the middle of nowhere</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@lawsome</strong></p>
<p>Has the strikes and the resulting concessions resulted in their wealth noticeably going down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With minimum wages some industries need to devote more profits to worker pay, meaning less money for the capitalists. But it's not a huge difference, most industries pay pretty well in Canada.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's the safe and cowardly way, sure. I prefer to ride the boom and use the money to invest in other industries so things don't fall apart when the boom ends.</p>
<p>As a smaller nation risks are often worth taking</p>
<p>Because the alternative is staying small and irrelevant</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Avian Overlord</strong></p>

<p>That was the plan for Russia but the game crashed</p>
<p>Might try that again some time</p>
<p>I don't really like playing militaristic countries</p>
<p>I mostly like to develop my economy and play the internal politics game</p>
<p>I guess one downside of my AAR's is that you're only getting my playstyle, and my commentary on things that I personally find interesting</p>
<p>I can't really say whether the way I play will be representative of most players, because the game isn't out yet.</p>

<p>I think it will be harder to find the time and energy to do this when I get back to work. And being in work mode will tempt me to fix bugs etc while I play instead of just enjoying the game. Work definitely has an impact, and I'm trying to have a healthy work-life balance by playing just for fun and not to generate bug reports or design feedback</p>

<p>Release will be in the future, assuming no cancellation or civilization-ending apocalyptic events</p>

<h4>AAR : Canada - Pt.3 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>I think it's Canada time again. CONFEDERATED CANADA continues here</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@MasterPaw</strong></p>
<p>What are you goals now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still need public healthcare, but I guess things have evolved a bit. New goal is social democratic utopia.</p>
<p>So I've run into a bit of a blocker in terms of reforms. I have this really powerful capitalist class who really really don't enjoy things like worker's rights and welfare. Their power bases are the industries that support our economy - coal, wood, motors, chemicals. These industries are the very same that the Trade Unions draw their own ranks from, so I can't just transition my economy to other industries to disempower the capitalists.</p>
<p>I need to figure out a way to continue passing reforms without the Industrialists overthrowing the government</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Prymalfire</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like a meme, but seizing the means of production does look like an answer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would definitely cause the revolution I'm trying to avoid, is the problem</p>
<p>One thing I can do is invest further in Internal Security through my Guaranteed Liberties law. This will make revolutions much less likely to succeed. But that just gives me a buffer, I'll still hit a wall eventually</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@lawsome</strong></p>
<p>Would stronger income taxation help curb their power?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I expect it would. Relieving the tax burden from the lower strata and adding it to the upper strata will definitely even out the balance of power..</p>
<p>Our current income tax law is Payroll Tax, which primary puts the tax burden on the lower and middle strata</p>
<p>I could actually move to Proportional Income Tax without radicalizing the Industrialists..</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Prymalfire</strong></p>
<p>If you agitate the trade unions and accept their demands, do the industrialists get as mad as if you did it yourself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They like me far too much for that to be an option</p>
<p>I think I'll let the Industrialists cool off from all those other laws I passed for a while, while I expand my institutions. Then I'll try for Proportional Income Tax. And while that's all going on, I think it's time for Women's Suffrage</p>
<p>This is the first time that one of my reforms has actually been opposed my Mackenzie's Intelligentsia. Liberals like progress, but not too much progress.</p>
<p>I think it may be time to form a government that does not include the Intelligentsia</p>
<p>The Mackenzie government is over. He had a great run. Under his watch Canada become a successful, industrialized, and progressive nation.</p>
<p>Now it's time for a new Governor. Gordon Maitland is leader of the Trade Unions, and he has strong Feminist beliefs. He firmly believes in he need for universal Women's Suffrage.</p>
<p>Since we're passing a law that the Intelligentsia don't like, and we've also kicked them out of the government, we're no longer getting their bonuses. Goodbye 100% migration attraction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@veluum</strong></p>
<p>No more burden on bureaucracy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still need to expand our government administrations to prepare for more burdens on the bureaucracy however. We have a lot of institutions to expand!</p>
<p>I'll simultaneously expand Internal Security and Social Security. I'm doubling the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Building a lot of administration buildings to keep up with these institutions</p>
<p>Also, time to use dynamite in the Yukon iron mines</p>
<p>We also really need to expand our railway infrastructure</p>
<p>There must be a better way than expanding railways..</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a separate country</p>
<p>Oh I see where the landowners are drawing power. There's no jobs in the more remote areas, but they've still received some migrants. This has made subsistence farms return, and those employ aristocrats which support the Landowners.</p>
<p>We can address this by developing more of the country</p>

<p>Just realized we're still investing in Colonialism. I'll downsize that for now, and make a not to abolish the law eventually</p>

<p>We actually have one law that gives power to the landowners... Peasant Levies</p>
<p>If we got rid of that we could probably marginalize the Landowners again</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Minimum wage is slowly being scaled back</p>

<h4>AAR : Canada - Pt.4 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>It's time for the thrilling conclusion of CONFEDERATED CANADA</p>
<p>And it is the conclusion because I've already finished playing. I'll just be reporting on what happened up to the end.</p>
<p>Quite a lot has happened. I think when I last reported an update, Canada was in a bit of a rough patch, with business struggling to pay workers due to the high minimum wage</p>
<p>Through extensive economic micro I was able to mitigate this problem through the use of TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>Inventions such as the Steam Donkey allowed me to activate production methods that automated my industry to a greater degree, generating more outputs. This requires more material inputs like coal and tools, but the reduction in less qualified labourers meant a huge reduction in wage expenses.</p>
<p>This did slightly empower the Industrialists and disempower the Trade Unions, but not as much as you'd think. Although we employed less lower strata pops overall, we employed more Machinists who are more likely to be politically engaged, and those machinists make excellent wages due to the their profitable places of employment. (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>does this not lead to unemployment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but we have welfare so there's a floor to how poor pops can be</p>
<p>Shortly after dealing with the economic problem, the Feminist movement kicked off for real. The previous attempt at enacting Women's Suffrage rested on the political will of one man - this time it was supported by the voice of a nation. Despite fairly significant resistance, eventually even the PB were swayed to the cause. Canada now has universal suffrage for all citizens.</p>
<p>Oh and I don't remember at which point I did this or even if I did it in an earlier update, but I have Proportional Income tax now, so every pop is taxed and equal portion of their total wealth. This helped to reduce the wealth gap.</p>
<p>Something truly revolutionary happened in Ontario. A man dug a hole in the ground and struck oil.</p>
<p>Oil turned out to have a broad set of applications, some of which remain undiscovered. For now we are primarily using it in our newly developed Furniture Manufactories using the Mechanized Workshops PM</p>
<p>We are able to churn out mountains of furniture every day. Oil has become more valuable than gold.</p>
<p>And since furniture manufactories can be built anywhere, I decided that the more remote parts of the country should share in the wealth. Even Nunavut has a healthy furniture industry at this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@makapse</strong></p>
<p>didnt those thieving british overlords steal your oil too?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Brits don't seem interested in this technology as of yet.</p>
<p>Later we also found a source of oil in Alberta</p>
<p>At this point the oil rigs in Ontario are the 3 most productive building in the world, measured by yearly productivity per employee. The profits are immense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>At this point the oil rigs in Ontario are the 3 most productive building in the world, measured by yearly productivity per employee. The profits are immense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh I just researched Combustion Engines. After switching PM's in the oil rig, it's now the #1 most productive building in the world, generating £55,000 per week in profit.</p>
<p>Oil and furniture brought employment to many, many more people in Canada, raising SoL significantly</p>
<p>The Trade Unions got a new leader, and thus the country got a new governor. William Thompson is a Social Democrat - he believes in the achievement of socialism through reformist and electoral means.</p>
<p>His first act was to begin enacting Old Age Pensions, which passed on its first run through the legal system. Though this did slightly reduce the workforce ratio, this wasn't really a problem because there were already more people than available jobs. The benefit of this law was that the income and political participation of dependents increased drastically. And these newly "enfranchised" people supported the Unions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Kadaeux</strong></p>
<p>Are you going from memory or did you write this down</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going from memory</p>
<p>With most IG's appeased by the recent passing of Women's Suffrage and the massive influx of new supporters for Thompson's socialist reforms, there was a brief window of opportunity to do the unthinkable. We enacted Council Republic through peaceful, legal means. (there was also a bug where the Industrialists failed to oppose the law, probably wouldn't have been able to do this otherwise). (edited)</p>
<p>Chairman William Thompson, leader of the People's Dominion of Canada, decreed a total reorganization of the nation's political system. Every workplace became a worker's co-operative - private ownership of industry was entirely abolished. Without the capitalist class taking the lion's share of profits for their own selfish use, business boomed. Nearly every industry saw an increase in profitability, and these profits were distributed among the workers. (edited)</p>
<p>The nation remains highly democratic and free. The electoral system has changed somewhat. Workers now elect delegates to local councils, and those local councils elect representatives to regional councils, who elect delegates to the central government. It's a very bottom-up system.</p>
<p>The total abolition of private ownership essentially abolished the capitalist class. There are however a few stragglers. I am playing the world's smallest violin.</p>

<p>Due to various mass migration movements and gradual assimilation, Anglo-Canadians now make up about half of the total population, which is more than it's been since we had that gigantic influx of migrants.

<p>It's pretty average. Stable and unexciting.</p>

<p>Out of 14 million citizens, 8 million are Loyalists. The council system has the overwhelming support of the people.</p>
<p>Literacy is over 90%</p>
<p>The balance of power has shifted drastically. Where once Anglo-Canadians held disproportionate political power, each culture now has pretty much exactly equal power to their population share.</p>
<p>Things are not so equal when it comes to professions. Machinists are around 3x more powerful than their population share. Due to political disengagement Laborers are still only at about 2/3 of the population share. Peasants are totally disengaged and have no power - we've been working on abolition subsistence farming anyway. Engineers are also very powerful. Some engineers support the Industrialist IG, keeping that group relevant.</p>
<p>So that's it. Canada has become a socialist utopia and economic powerhouse through a triumph of democracy.</p>

<p>If interest groups can change policy does that mean you can get the bonus of immigration from intelligentsia while not dismantling everything/council republic</p>

<p>Potentially but not sure how I'll get the Intelligentsia to like me THAT much again. When I had that bonus they were in government and I was constantly passing policies they liked.</p>

<p>shhhh</p>

<p><strong>@Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>
<p>It's not a bug, it's a feature that the industrialists were not invited to the chamber when the law was being signed</p>

<p>They were all asleep for a couple of years</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>i'd like to think they are still mourning the loss of Mackenzie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mackenzie was the Intelligentsia leader. Though for most of his terms of office the Industrialists were part of his coalition government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Does Canada still not have armed forces?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None whatsoever.</p>
<p>Something I find quite interesting is how hugely my internal politics were affected by never developing agricultural industry. There are almost no farms in Canada at all. This would have made my life more difficult, as well as created a pretty different final state of internal politics. Farms employ aristocrats, farmers, and clergymen, who would have made the Devout, Landowners, and Rural Folk significant players while in my playthrough they were irrelevant for most of the game.</p>
<p>The Council Republic law also specifically empowers Machinists and Farmers. A more agrarian communist Canada would have to contend with a very powerful Rural Folk IG</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Do farms always creat Aristocrats? For example in the US where in large parts the medium sized family farm was dominant (similiar to Southern and Western Germany later on) it make no sense for there to be Aristocrats employed in farms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not always! You can transition them to private ownership instead later on so they're owned by capitalists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Not always! You can transition them to private ownership instead later on so they're owned by capitalists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course with a worker co-op it's owned by farmers primarily</p>
<p>GB knows that attempting to mess with me would be a terrible idea. They are utterly economically dependent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Thorius</strong></p>
<p>Is it possible to be split? Like in the USA, where there is private ownership in the North and quasi aristocratic slave plantations in the south? (Similiar to Prussia, where aristocratic farms dominate east of the Elbe, while the Rhine Province is mostly medium sized family farms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>is this actually in the AI logic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They'd take the opposing side in a revolution against my government, but overlords won't start plays to force their subjects to change their government</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>
<p>How is this possible? This is an amazing mechanic to have even be in the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can have different PM's in different parts of your country. PM's are on a per-building basis, not national/</p>
<p>Any final questions before I close the game and end the playthrough forever?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Kadaeux</strong></p>
<p>Who do you want to play next?</p>

<p>I have no idea!</p>

<p><strong>@Trinexx (CK Community)</strong></p>
<p>Compared to previous playthroughs you've done, how  was this one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one was very fun. And a lot more varied than I was expecting. The early OPM boom was fantastic, I enjoyed adapting to having to integrate more and more Canadian states, Mackenzie was super cool especially his death, and the bumpy road to socialism was interesting.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>A day later than before you asked</p>

<p>£250 million</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>

<p>I guess this term is outdated in V3. OSM (one state minor) might be more appropriate. Though that ignores split states being a thing - and I did start out without even one entire state (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@OttoVonNoob</strong></p>
<p>are undiscovered resources in provinces pre determined like oil in middle east? or is there some chance</p>

<p>Predetermined, but discovery is random</p>

<p>Almost certainly. If we ever design a communist flag I'd want a maple leaf</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>Did you manage to produce enough electricity that your industries could use it over the UK's</p>

<p>Yes! Our coal-fired power plants produce plenty of electricity for all our needs. Including electric trains</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Things have mostly been pretty stable. Catalonia exists though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Balkan Devastation Enjoyer</strong></p>
<p>are there no disadvantages to worker coops in V3?</p>

<p>That depends on your goals. If you want a capitalist society then worker co-ops are the mechanisms of satan</p>
<p>But financially worker co-ops are just better, at least in th current build</p>

<p>I guess I'd start farming and building an army, in preparation for an independence war</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@makapse</strong></p>

<p>British GDP/capita is £3.39. Ours is £17.20. We are winning.</p>

<p>Nah, I wanted this run to be a chill non-military playthrough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>
<p>Is this intended or just happenstance from the way capitalist/profit mechanics work atm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's just the way capitalists work. They take a lot of profit from industries by owning the means of production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Kadaeux</strong></p>
<p>With market access, are both you and the UK having equal priority to your electricity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Also, the world's largest consumer of electricity is Quebec</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Also, the world's largest consumer of electricity is Quebec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's largely due to their gigantic electric engine industry</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@context</strong></p>
<p>are the capitalists replaced by some kind of bureaucrat management job?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They would be if they were government-run, but we use worker co-ops so we just employ more laborers and machinists.</p>

<p>Currently public companies just employ even more capitalists, making the business drastically less profitable to no advantage other than maybe making the Industrialists more powerful. This should be changed before release.</p>

<p>@Daniel "neondt" Tolman  I have a question that I asked in the dev Q&amp;A but didn't get an answer to, perhaps there has been an dev diary already and I missed it but here I go and ask again. During 1880 to 1925 we had both electric cars and fossil-powered cars that were pretty much equal in power. Will we as players will be able to influence the outcome of the dominance of fossil-fueled cars or electric cars, because if that is the case we will also largely influence which resources will become important and also redirect sight for colonazation of the geographic areas. Keep in mind that this fossil-fueled VS electric goes beyond cars and touches tanks, trains, airplanes and industry too. Ty and sorry for the long text.</p>

<p>You actually can decide that you'd rather use electric motors and trains instead of diesel</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Circe</strong></p>
<p>Is there no advantage to having a larger amount of captalists?</p>

<p>Not financially. Now there are just a greater number of shareholders who want to drain the profits</p>

<p>Yes this would be an advantage!</p>

<p>But that's a national advantage, still hurts the building itself</p>

<h4>AAR : Lubeck Kiel - Pt.1 - by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>So if anyone want to know - I've decided on a little suicide pact game.
I'm playing as Lubeck - I am going to try and see if I can survive as North North Prussia 
(I've not tried this in some time)</p>
<p>Lubeck is literally just the city - first goal is to suck up to Prussia and see if they will be my homeboy so I can return something something Holstein</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CraneOQuill</strong></p>
<p>For some reason I thought he meant in Eu4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny note - Lubeck (or the Hansa) was the first nation I ever played in the EU series) which is why I come back to them in other games.</p>
<p>I have 1 lumber and 1 fishery possible.
First thing is to get some domestic resource and get a tool industry going so I can specialize.
(Distracted, dealing with a graphics bug I want to fix so I can see map entities better)</p>
<p>IIRC (restarting game to fix graphics) Lubeck is not in the Prussian Market, due to being a split state its currently a little too far under Danish influence.
But I want it to be on under the Prussian Market.</p>
<p>My good friend Prussia is gonna protect me, give me his pops, and then I will become the master</p>
<p>Assuming I survive</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MajorBandgeek</strong></p>
<p>no special "retake the hanseatic cities" journal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look, I only get soo many days of PDT.</p>
<p>And I was busy on Friday.</p>
<p>(sorry for the delay - I am fixing a graphics bug solely for myself because damn if I am going to be one city I want it to look pretty)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Godly Moose</strong></p>
<p>Will there be smog?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>only if I industrialize enough</p>
<p>I was not successful, but I will soldier on - so no screenshots sadly since things are placeholdery.
Some testing file on my home system is resetting my options</p>
<p>What is a small city going to to do to attract people?
Well first it must tackle the innate mortality that will come from attracting people en-masse.</p>
<p>I was gonna start with some basic healthcare, decent employment and a greener grass campaign.</p>
<p>If I am under Danish Market influence, might as well convince some Danes to join the city and work some jobs</p>
<p>There are two types of immigration, en masse due to turmoil and inter market due to standard of living - aka job opportunities.</p>
<p>So as a tiny nation who cannot throw its weight around, you need to start with the subtle influences, stealing pops.</p>
<p>Well... this is going to be harder.
Prussia wants nothing to do with my backwater, so any chance of a protectorate agreement or alliance is going to take some convincing.
Do I sell my soul to Britain instead?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>
<p>How strong of a source of population growth can immigration really be early on? I assume it's somewhat modified by access to transit, but is it feasible to double your population via migration within a decade or so as an OPM?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on how well you can attract, keep the pops, and put them to good work.</p>
<p>I have started diplomatic efforts to improve relations, they will take time.
But looking at the Prussian attitudes and and objectives means they are not as friendly as they could be.
Sell my soul to Denmark? And risk losing my working permit in Sweden?</p>
<p>The whole point of selling your soul as an OPM is to have it be backed up by a GP whose weight you can try and swing around on the world stage</p>
<p>(note to self, that's definitely busted )</p>
<p>FYI it looks like my current build might have some issues with population happiness.
This might turn into a "survive the inevitable workers revolution"</p>
<p>Its either that or something back end related to 1848 style stuff fired early cause... woah the German people are not happy.</p>
<p>I'm not in revolution - as a player I am 100% advantaged to see the writing on the wall faster than the AI.</p>
<p>But Denmark did just have a tiny peasant revolt.
And I can see the signs of dissatisfaction in Northern Germany</p>
<p>Turns out things are not broken, its ECONOMICS</p>
<p>Britain has put a bunch of tiny german cities under its market and they are not having it.</p>
<p>Danish situation may be that Danes themselves don't just like Danes either.</p>
<p>To me this is half the fun of playing a small nation, watching the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Funny note - Denmark is warring with itself, but as a neighbor I am incentivized to try and see it put to peace semi-quickly.</p>
<p>Because while I am not suffering devastation as the frontline, my shared state trade and infrastructure is seeing issues.</p>
<p>No one wants to migrate to a city near a warzone</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Balkan Devastation Enjoyer</strong></p>
<p>are you sure? maybe the correct answer is to build weapon factories, because it sounds like business is about to boom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't have enough raw material supplies to play the war merchant yet.</p>
<p>60% of my economy is a toolworkshop making tools for the construction of the rest of the economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jüstinyen</strong></p>
<p>So not only you share a market but also the infrastructure as well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are a split state along with holstein and hamburg so while we do not share all infrastructure (buildings made etc) the burning of regional infrastructure has a small effect on me, but they can grow large. (edited)</p>

<h4>AAR : Lubeck Kiel - Pt.2 - by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>Evening all, as soon as I am done being headbutted by a cat who has decided now is the time for attention. I will be starting Lubeck back up for a bit.
Been out ill today, but still want to do some slowplay and tinker with a few things though remember its unlikely for the revolutions and that to be majorly fixed in my build.</p>
<p>The good news is its not covid, hopefully with one more day of rest I will be feeling well enough to work.</p>
<p>But yeah the bug I stopped for yesterday is still there so I did some commands to make it... go away for now.</p>
<p>Alright, for those who need an update - its 1843. We are playing as Lubeck and have gone from a city state to cities state.</p>
<p>The world is going to hell and a handbasket, but our little merchant town is doing alright. So well we can turn off our consumption taxes and enjoy a bit of an eco boom off of it</p>
<p>Just shy of a million GDP - and we are reaching state limits on resource and agricultural buildings, so time to start using production methods to pump more value into the economy.</p>
<p>Since I now make ships, time for fisheries to utilize ships, because I 
1 - Need more fish
2 - That's going to increase ship demand
3 - Which will increase fabric and wood demand
4 - Which are also in my market!
I win multiple ways!</p>
<p>Well... except for anyone who was just getting by... like the furniture factory. Its gonna loose some profit</p>
<p>I am calculating the loss of sol for the clothes factory will be overcome by the increase in wages and sol in the other factories</p>
<p>But this is just an estimation, I am yet to see if this is true.</p>
<p>We are just about 650k pops.
And one cat advisor (excuse me a moment)</p>
<p>So...
Cut fish consumption taxes, increased fishing production.
Fish still ended up as more expensive because the number of pops who got an SoL increase bought more fish.</p>
<p>while not problematic, it is something I will have to make sure doesn't get too much higher relatively.</p>
<p>Working on cattle for fabric + meat subsitution, which will also make clippers a bit cheaper, etc.</p>
<p>All my industries are currently privately owned</p>
<p>Shipyards have quickly supplanted tools as the most profitable industry</p>
<p>The revenge of the clipper factory*
Remember that my economy is still small, its only 3-4 factories atm</p>
<p>I... just got Vasa'd (edited)</p>
<p>Who the hell wrote this.</p>
<p>No, its just funny.</p>
<p>To me it feels like the Vasa, but its clearly a ships of the time event.</p>
<p>Because my industrialists were like "to celebrate our shipping industry we need to build a GIANT SHIP"</p>
<p>It did not go well</p>
<p>Definitely could use a little polish because it felt like it just took off and sank.</p>
<p>So felt more Vasa than Titanic</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know - the Vasa was a Swedish Royal ship that never made it out of the harbor.</p>
<p>anyways, that made me laugh</p>
<p>So...
dropping consumption taxes and telling industries to buy complementary industry goods.
little to no pop change, all of a sudden my GDP is up 50%</p>
<p>Is that real evaluation? No, its mostly inflationary prices, but still that number makes me look more prestigious - and I need Prussia to like me enough to allow me in their market</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr.healthy</strong></p>
<p>will they kick u out if your not continuously improving relations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not 100% sure, I will have to maintain some level of relations but not max all the time.
I still have to border them and not be a minor power so it depends on how far I am able to achieve in that regard first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Ccrt</strong></p>
<p>Wow, what do you mean with "complementary industry goods"? Its like buying better hammers or better mechanical tools in general?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am having my fisheries use clippers to produce more, I am making clippers domestically, those clippers are using wood, tools and fabric from the domestic market.</p>
<p>That entire production line is local, the wages stay at home - those wages get spent on fish and other goods.</p>
<p>Its entirely dependent upon the product and comparative advantage.</p>
<p>I can do this semi-autarky due to my home resources.</p>
<p>BTW, Denamrk is in Rebellion (again).</p>
<p>Time to see if Schleswig-Holstein can become Lubeckian</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>I have a national militia only.</p>
<p>I keep making entreaties to Prussia and Austria to protect me</p>
<p>And Prussia is willing to consider, now its to make sure Austria stays out of it</p>
<p>I am toeing the line of upsetting Germany's Balance, but nothing too major has been done.</p>
<p>I don't think they can hear the Danes over the giant figurative bag of money I just plopped on the ambassador's desk.</p>
<p>(I did not actually bribe them, I just made entreaties of obligations)</p>
<p>Ones I hope they never ask for</p>
<p>The favor system will bite you in the butt if you are not careful</p>
<p>I am totally gambling.</p>
<p>But I also know that Denmark just had a revolution fire - they are not willing to fight two wars and with Austria on my side and Prussia leaning me they capitulated.</p>

<p>Oh, I still owe Austria the obligation. (edited)</p>

<p>I have heard that joke many a time.
I did study economics after all</p>
<p>90% of my economy is based on consumption taxes on fish alone</p>
<p>200k are Danish btw</p>
<p>Who are also now considered "just kinda like Germans" as far as the government is concerned</p>
<p>Plans right now are still to get into the Prussian Market, but since I am afloat with funds - I am going to start diversifying my consumption tax on more luxury items and increase government expenditures on institutions.</p>
<p>I've got a robust health system, a decent religious education, and a local police force (due to turmoil in this build)</p>
<p>The police kina empower the landowners and well... we cannot have that though</p>
<p>Btw, Prussia thinks that my threatening of kicking Denmarks butt is now so badass (also I have a trade fleet) that they are willing to consider customs union.
Just need to grow my comparative GDP a bit more.</p>
<p>I'm still insignificant, but I am less insignificant</p>
<p>Hmm... to reform the economic system, or institute poor laws</p>
<p>Who can I afford to piss off</p>
<p>No, but I have a sizeable trade fleet now that they were willing to overlook it (or Mecklenburg joined the market, didn;t check)</p>
<p>1 State</p>
<p>It is!</p>
<p>Starting the long reform of the economic system away from a traditional model. While this empowers the industrialists, they are aligned with the intelligentsia and thus I am willing to accept that.</p>
<p>No mines in my state</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure we've talked about this system.
So unless someone links me a screenshot of the economy systems I am going to be mum</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I still have the graphics bug from before so little to no screenshots as I am literally working on a placeholder build atm.</p>
<p>Oh guess what?
Its not in that screenshot 
Guess we've been doing some tinkering - imagine that!</p>
<p>(gasp)</p>
<p>Sorry, I could not help trolling you all a little there.</p>
<p>While I expect Mikael and Martin wouldn't be too mad, I don't know if this is done yet and worth talking about as if its finished.</p>
<p>I am interested by the adaptation it seems to be though. Even if its not a fully new system its a better named reflection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately regardless of how cool it looked - the threat of radicalization and revolution by the conservatives has made us put that reform to the side for now.</p>
<p>I cannot afford a civil war and they are still kinda upset about the national militia thing.
So will try for something smaller and well try and diminish their clout</p>
<p>Like idk... reform the police so they stop getting empowered by it</p>
<p>Guess it sucks to be the landowners</p>
<p>Aha... no - that would still cause a revolution problem.</p>
<p>What to do... what to do.</p>
<p>Guess its a time for a little suppression campaign, some poor laws so they get happy enough that they DO NOT SEE THEIR POLITICAL END COMING</p>
<p>In the meaning I'm watching my wood economy collapse as the prices of tools may have shot past the price of a tree.</p>
<p>That's what I get for not paying attention</p>
<p>sol is relatively stable.</p>
<p>I may have disbanded a charity campaign that increased minimum wealth to start suppressing the landowners because they stand in the way of my progress.
It had knock-on effects.</p>
<p>Its not going smoothly, but its certainly fun!</p>
<p>I push the limits of my economy a bit faster than Tolman and others do.</p>
<p>Yeah, its called not let everything fall apart</p>
<p>And if it does - all hail the revolution.</p>
<p>Alright... we are trying to reform our economy again.
This time the Landowners are standing against it, but they've not signaled any radical ideas yet</p>

<p>It means I cannot remember and don't look at the math behind the curtain</p>
<p>Yea... that whole national militia of armed civilians they hate is large enough.</p>
<p>But I do not want to cause a civil war if I can avoid it</p>
<p>dammit... the conservatives choose now to start doing well in the polls?</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>I do not have enough of an economy to support Unis.</p>
<p>Suppression is not immediate and they have a lot of clout</p>
<p>So I can slow their growth and work against them, but they do not want to go down without a fight.</p>

<p>AHA! Suppressions take time!</p>

<p>Is that news to all of you? I could of sworn we've said that multiple times.</p>
<p>Damn Prussian Civil war is messing up all my iron imports.</p>
<p>That's why my economy is less stable</p>
<p>Aha figured it out.
Prussia's civil war cause a throwing around of relations, the Custom's Union lost a few members and that threw the resources out of whack.</p>
<p>Because of the Civil war their entire Ruhr industry is kinda... isolated.
Oof thats rough</p>
<p>Right now Austria is trying to hold itself together</p>
<p>You need to remember that EVERYONE is having turmoil issues, which is why I am going fairly heavy on sol and police.</p>
<p>We are a beacon of relative stability</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lloyien</strong></p>
<p>How obvious would you say these things are to noneconomists playing the game, Paul?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may take you a few more steps maybe to find out why this is a problem, but tooltips in tooltips and the mapmodes make things relatively intuitive.</p>
<p>Like to figure out that the issue was I was importing no iron was looking at my industry shortage notification -&gt; seeing iron was expensive -&gt; going to my market trade routes -&gt; seeing no trade incoming -&gt; going to prussian market -&gt; noticing all the isolated market zones due to the war.</p>
<p>And it was obvious every step of the way.</p>
<p>Importing stuff from abroad is meaning that my industries are paying the wages of foreign workers</p>
<p>But I need the iron to create advantages in my country to grow faster, and its a worthwhile expense</p>
<p>This is why I am trying to get into the Prussian Market</p>
<p>so I will inherently have better access to it</p>
<p>But we are up to ~2.5 million GDP</p>
<p>and maybe .5 - 1mil more and Prussia will see us as a reasonable market partner.</p>
<p>Or... maybe the economy tanking due to the revolution has changed their minds.</p>
<p>Its made them... more amenable but I stg its like -1 on the decision math</p>

<p>They tend to favor the more intelligent discussions and parties</p>
<p>Economy is relatively stable on taxing luxury clothes and meat.</p>
<p>There is enough well off folks that I can move my profits to the middle class instead of the working class.</p>
<p>And while the working class consume meat - the tax makes them go towards fish and grain - which are local.</p>

<p>Goods subsitution is my favorite "not immediately obvious" system.</p>

<p>The world is suffering a lot of turmoil, and because of that the abundance of European industrialization is not here yet.</p>
<p>I'm not map painting for wood.</p>
<p>I've already decided its going to be going for the Prussian Market and they are "so close" to letting me in.</p>
<p>And taking over that market is how I will slowly surplant them</p>
<p>Though I may make designs on this German state to my east.</p>
<p>Most likely a tool and ship based economy, then moved to further industrial goods and steel refining.</p>

<p>They are migrating there because its better there than it is back home</p>

<p><strong>Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Don't hit it too hard - my family did move there historically.</p>
<p>They did fine for awhile</p>
<p>unemployed are in the subsistence farms</p>
<p>Alright took a moment to go find the history book on the shelf. The families heimatvertreibung from 1984</p>
<p>It was the 40 year anniversary of being expelled</p>
<p>fyi - family on my fathers side is Yugoslavian Germans.</p>
<p>Gods my german is rusty</p>
<p>Aha</p>
<p>Familie Josef Depre aus Kruschevlje, Yugoslavien.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly thats northern Serbia of the general Banat/Vovodjynia region.</p>
<p>I don't have a map anymore and the town doesn't really exist.</p>
<p>Still neat little history is literally I just watched my family migrate from our homeland to Banat.</p>
<p>If I find someone hardcoded this, I'm gonna be very</p>
<p>afk to feed the cats - putting the train industry to produce.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes problem is the family history books didn't survive the turning of the town into a concentration camp with the liberation of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>So I have no idea which wave of migration they were</p>
<p>Anecdotally my grandfather always claimed it was the family trying to "get away from the Franco-Prussian War Business" being French-Germans.</p>
<p>But I've no proof of that</p>
<p>Everything is simulated.
The game is a simulation 
(its just not simulated the way you assume)</p>
<p>Inflation is not a mechanic that is apparent, and trust me seeing things like inflation with price changes is hard to grasp even when you know what you are looking at.
But inflation eating at the gold reserves of countries that are wasting money is definitely a thing, just not a big big big thing.</p>
<p>I wish it were bigger - one day.</p>
<p>Yes that is what I was referring to - the treasury mechanics.</p>
<p>So we now have trains, and now due to this crazy thing called trying to produce locomotives - its our number 1 industry.</p>
<p>You wanna talk about speculation? I cannot maintain this goods production because I FORGOT STEEL</p>

<p>Not sure, let me check</p>
<p>So barely anyone makes locomotives - I am the second producer atm.</p>
<p>And little to no one uses them.
I'm not sure WHY but Banat and Vojvodina are trying to buy it in Austria.</p>
<p>Wtf is going on down there.</p>
<p>Oh... thats such a bug</p>
<p>Like, the AI is trying its best to react the migration but my god that was NOT the answer</p>
<p>So AI is trying to develop the industries down there, and wants steel, etc.</p>
<p>But it kinda overfocused on railroads not realizing it wasn't a production problem it was a good shortage problem.</p>
<p>Thats a neat AI bug - I will make sure thats noted</p>
<p>That's the kind of logic you would have plaguing you in V2 all the time.</p>
<p>Its seeing high transportation costs and is going "I need more railways" but not recognizing the high cost is not due to low production itself due to output potential but is due to a shortage of steel specifically, which is shorting locomotives, etc. (edited)</p>
<p>It figured it out eventually (its building steel now) but it may have overcompensated in railroads a bit too long.</p>

<h4>AAR : Lubeck Kiel - Pt.3 - by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>I may have fixed the visual bug - we will see if it creates any stability issues running at higher force.
And yes I noticed many of you commented on the Capital moving to Kiel though we are technically Lubeck.</p>
<p>Capitals are based in the main city hub by default, lubeck is technically a port hub (visual clarifications on map).
This is the intended default - much like with namable factories and entities we want to look into making capitals be a bit more moveable and customizable but that's lower priority. (edited)</p>

<p>Alright, things look as stable as they can be with the world on fire due to revolution and turmoil.
Last time we looked at Lubeck - we were moving to Trains and Steel, and we will be continuing work on those endeavors because we've plateau'd our industry.
I can't just throw pops at the factories anymore, I need to make things more efficient.</p>
<p>If you want to know how bad the turmoil is in parts of the world.
The most recently free Revolutionary Brittany just had its own uprising.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Are other countries producing locomotives yet? I remember you saying it was just you and maybe one other last time.</p>

<p>Its mainly me and Britain, but thats more that economic progress has stalled due to immense amounts of turmoil.</p>
<p>Landowners have decided to get off their buts and start movements to roll back all "government anti-landowner bias"

<p>No that would be stupid</p>

Nothing more leftist... yet.</p>
<p>So... we need iron</p>
<p>for steel - for locomotives</p>
<p>I am in the Prussian Market but they are having turmoil problems with production.</p>
<p>And I need more... always more</p>
<p>Its not easy, but it is a fun challenge.</p>

<p>Invading with a Militia is not possible, I could either convince Prussia to do the legwork for me or maybe its time to make a City Guard</p>
<p>Going to start prio'ing some Barracks to make an army to help establish North North Prussia.</p>
<p>Also some shipyards and trade centers so I can pull more trade into Prussian Market for my advantage.</p>
<p>How many dev diaries can there be?
How many dev diaries do you want?</p>
<p>You think we cannot talk about things for days on end?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Umbrellaworker</strong></p>
<p>Can players have many diplomatic plays at the same time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and No.
There are some restrictions in play to prevent cheesing but you can be involved in many things around the world at the same time.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have words with the designer that wrote "A Malthusian argument"</p>
<p>1 - Correct
2 - Funny</p>
<p>Please stop with the dev diary calculations</p>
<p>Everytime you post them I am obligated to add 1-3 more dev diaries to the list</p>
<p>Hamburg/Bremen/Oldenburg/Hannover 
As is tradition with my Lubeck games, time to head west.</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>I will post screenshots when I feel like it, as a treat</p>
<p>Alright, Prussia is innately on my side</p>
<p>Prussia is my homeboi</p>
<p>I hold up the market</p>
<p>Comparatively I am now 50% Prussia's size in GDP</p>
<p>I'm just 1 state</p>
<p>Prussia may be dealing with a Saarbrucken revolution but they are what you would expected them to be.</p>
<p>Turmoil problems, also I am totally NOT speculating on the Train Market</p>
<p>Prussia controls the market as they are the leader of the customs union.
My size does not matter in this regard, I agreed to this agreement and would have to get them to agree to the reverse.</p>
<p>No one came to Oldenburg's defense</p>
<p>Nom</p>
<p>So new Lubeckian hannover is in an incredibly poor state</p>
<p>Pops are starving, government broke down due to turmoil.</p>
<p>Before I can extract iron, I need to stabilize the situation</p>
<p>Starting with some emergency relief</p>
<p>I will also start incorporating the state</p>
<p>Ah, this explains the problems of Oldenburg - they were brought down by a set of successive crop failures</p>
<p>And government actions to mitigate it also failed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>
<p>So it's basically waiting for your institutions to kick in in your new territory? I assume all newly acquired territory will temporarily become very poor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are assuming that institutions alone are the reason pops hold wealth, they can buttress the situation but its not assumed.
The state does not immediately become poor because they were unincorporated. In this case they were already poor and struggling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mppqlmd</strong></p>
<p>THIS !! Crop failures are confirmed !!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty sure this isn't news, we've mentioned we don't have a full mechanic but it is handled in the journal/event system before.</p>
<p>Well... shit</p>
<p>I may have over industrialized the Prussian Market.</p>
<p>We are so short on iron, goods shortages are starting in my economy - which I was subsiding and... it aint pretty.</p>
<p>Price aren't crashing but my reserves are draining</p>
<p>We are so short on coal and iron and things are stalling and price hikes are everywhere</p>
<p>Prices have to crash</p>
<p>otherwise I will go bankrupt eventually</p>
<p>Just means I need to expedite my acquisition of the West and work more on trade to buttress these problems.</p>
<p>to be fair, I have been going by without taxing any goods for a long time.</p>
<p>Time to change that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mppqlmd</strong></p>
<p>are you a Ruhr-al economy ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horrible pun, I love it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Avian Overlord</strong></p>
<p>That sounds dangerous with prices increasing already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life is worth taking risks</p>
<p>Alright I was able to bluster for some more of hannover, but its starting to get me shifty eyes across the world stage. (edited)</p>
<p>So am halting the expansion for now to try and stabilize what of the state I have and work on trade</p>
<p>trying to build up trade while you are suffereing shortages to build is NOT FUN</p>

<h4>AAR : Lubeck Kiel - Pt.4 - by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>Its 1857, we are not so tiny Lubeck
Turmoil problems have been sorted, as if by the invisible hand of god (thanks Wiz!)
But also it turns out that our memories of the past are as rough as our current bureaucracy - we are heavily in the red.</p>
<p>But this is where we stand</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Lubeck%20Kiel%20-%20Pt.4%20-/6973393cf34ca9a2-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Lubeck%20Kiel%20-%20Pt.4%20-/6973393cf34ca9a2-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: #18 Liibeck 68 9.M 11.5 5.27M</font></p>
<p>68 Prestige
9.2 Million GDP
11.5 SoL
5.27 Million pops</p>
<p>Now I expect holding onto this rank will be harder, as the AI will not suffer as much turmoil - so it will truly be a position of holding onto power</p>
<p>The rebalancing of the books... has not been kind for this minor power</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Lubeck%20Kiel%20-%20Pt.4%20-/013065a3d73c3abc-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Lubeck%20Kiel%20-%20Pt.4%20-/013065a3d73c3abc-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: -130 150 +345 € 462K</font></p>
<p>But we shall persevere</p>
<p>No thats 700k pounds of debt</p>
<p>and a 46k deficit</p>
<p>Most of the cost seems to be in construction, we are currently deficit spending.</p>
<p>It will, but less than the continual turmoil</p>
<p>We are massively short on fabric in Lubeck - so that's what is driving costs up across the board</p>
<p>I'm not fully in control of my market, remember I share it with Prussia</p>
<p>So, I do expect them to assist in balancing things but building up trade to procure resources for us will be important</p>
<p>Gonna refocs on gov administration and trade centers</p>
<p>I am in the Prussian Market, the goal is to subject Prussia to ours - but we need to outrank them</p>
<p>One day</p>
<p>No, further information on Trade will come in a future dev diary</p>
<p>Anything I allude to here is to be assumed as "not yet in a final form"</p>
<p>hehe... I broke the budget graph due to the rebalance</p>
<p>the line went off the charts</p>
<p>National Militia</p>
<p>And I am downgrading my police force, as turmoil should be less of an issue - this will save some bureaucracy</p>
<p>A rebalancing of the books now has Lubeck at 1.25 Million debt and -15k deficit</p>
<p>Building solely from the investment fund of specific industries will help alleviate that for awhile, but a lot of that -15k is construction which is important still</p>
<p>Prussia is 8th in the world</p>
<p>I am 16</p>
<p>I may be going a bit all in on the "pay your share" to restore the world</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Lubeck%20Kiel%20-%20Pt.4%20-/923dfc1044bb44aa-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Lubeck%20Kiel%20-%20Pt.4%20-/923dfc1044bb44aa-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: Consumption Taxes 0+127K</font></p>
<p>Proper Lubeckians eat FISH</p>
<p>and support the domestic industries</p>
<p>You need to remember 90% of my income is based around consumption taxes</p>
<p>I am playing as a market republic for that reason</p>
<p>Market Republic is just my term for Lubeck - I'm not a large enough economy so its heavily based on market economy works</p>
<p>My main influence of production, consumption, and taxation is based on where the Prussian market is going</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roses [Vanguardist-Staffordist]</strong></p>
<p>is the shown tax income weekly and is your gdp still around 9 million? if so, wow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My GD is now 10.6 Million</p>
<p>I can tax revenue, but income of pops drives consumption</p>
<p>Why not tax consumption on already profitable industries and support the others by goods subsitution?</p>
<p>Consumption tax is not meta but a meta - it costs a lot of authority and comes at the cost of enacting a lot of other things.
But its the levers I am comfortable working with</p>
<p>That's just mean, the world is harsh enough to the peasants</p>
<p>We welcome the downtrodden to Lubeck - to rebuild and to florish.</p>
<p>Our economy is literally based on being a beacon of stability in a post-turmoil world</p>
<p>We've almost wiped the debts of lubeck clean</p>
<p>Once we do that - we will reduce taxes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>People SoL probably declineing and therefore radicalizeing because of the taxes, but i guess Paul knows whats he doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly hope so</p>
<p>I've already cut taxes by 25%</p>
<p>So a rebalanced economy means its time to return to trains</p>
<p>And to start putting trains to industrial work - hauling goods</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Roses [Vanguardist-Staffordist]</strong></p>
<p>he's making 60% of his gdp in taxes and thats crazy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are off by a 10th placement.
12 Million GDP
200K in tax revenue (at one point)
Thats 6% (edited)</p>
<p>Oh... you multiplied by the weeks</p>
<p>Ah I see where you got your 60% then.</p>
<p>Income and tax is weekly.</p>
<p>So actually you are not that far off 
But also - I'm totally cooking a book still from last time with subsidies and forcing my market to go towards trains and steel.</p>
<p>So the taxes are literally being syphoned to subsidies</p>
<p>US has cleared the plains, not gone to war with Mexico - but has a Revolutionary Oregon to deal with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roses [Vanguardist-Staffordist]</strong></p>
<p>thats crazy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its merely fiscal policy</p>
<p>Expecting Victoria to be a 1:1 of historical economy when you enter the game with knowledge of such things as a technical revolution and innate understanding of internal and external margins is a hard sell</p>
<p>Because we have already experienced this part of history - we know where to go and what will work (within reason)</p>

<p>Thats because you are thinking of modern inflation based prices.</p>

<p>I am building trains</p>
<p>We are to pump our industry by them</p>
<p>Well, put it in drive</p>
<p>Progress Party is working with the Christian Parties.</p>
<p>And would you look at that! The Trade Unionists are starting to become relevant</p>
<p>My machinations are starting to work</p>
<p>Holy...</p>
<p>The Irish had an uprising</p>
<p>No I mean they are independent, they got the whole island and are now a great power.</p>
<p>There might need to be some balancing in prestige with that</p>
<p>They do not have the economy to even back up their army right now</p>
<p>Prestige is mainly based on the number of troops they are supporting here (among other things)</p>
<p>You need to remember, the world was in so much turmoil for 20 years the armies are drained.
So their popular uprising has 2x the troops of the British Empire</p>
<p>Its just a side effect of our turmoil bug</p>
<p>Thinking of trying to take over Mecklenberg-Strelitz - the tiny province opm to our east.
They are struggling so much that its giving my pops turmoil.</p>
<p>They went with a Constitutional Monarchy in Ireland this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yagami913</strong></p>
<p>Turmoil spread through borders?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its less a mechanic but I think its 1 of 2 things working here (not sure if intended or not).
Split states can currently cause some calculation issues</p>
<p>But because that part of the state is having issues regardless, its not contributing to the general market.
We already know their split state turmoil effects migration and infrastructure retention in my part of the state (from the early part of the AAR with Holstein)</p>
<p>So their turmoil is causing trade + resource efficiency issues which is itself causing turmoil in my state (I believe)</p>
<p>Which makes migration to all the new factories harder to sell</p>
<p>The game is under development</p>
<p>There are plenty of issues</p>
<p>And we are working on them</p>
<p>I think this one is less a "functional bug" and more a "we could provide this information better" bug</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Avian Overlord</strong></p>
<p>Turmoil crossing borders does make sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unrest has never in history respected the political arbitrations of man</p>
<p>If you assume that its all the same, sure.
But turmoil is many different things.</p>
<p>Having to start a diplo play to conquer territory to prevent turmoil spreading over is kinda how Lubeck started to grow</p>
<p>No, they ceded</p>
<p>And if you remember my original campaigns to mess with the landowner class.
They... may have just assassinated someone.</p>
<p>It was a one province change</p>
<p>No need for map screenshot</p>
<p>You will find out when it happens to you</p>
<p>No Austrian Archduke</p>
<p>But since the Landowners have fired a shot, I am passing legislation to remove the hereditary bureaucratic rights of their class.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help see rise to a new intellegentsia</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>zan</strong></p>
<p>Any Germans with bushy beards started writing any books yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit busy playing Victoria 3 to write any books</p>
<p>I do need to start paying more attention to my politics and government instead of just "line goes up"</p>
<p>Radicalization is at levels that if I don't do reforms softly, I will loose quite a bit in a civil war</p>
<p>Well a bunch of landowners want traditionalism</p>
<p>The clergy is getting upset with my slow empowering of all</p>
<p>And the secret police are going to be put into play.</p>
<p>very much so</p>
<p>(Totally not listening to Mike Duncan's Revolutions in the background :D)</p>
<p>Nothing too much on tech, haven't been prioing it</p>
<p>But since the world is recovering I will need to focus production techs to keep my advantage.</p>
<p>We've reached the limit of what economics alone can do for power growth, I am 100% striking above my weight as a tiny nation of 7million Pops with little to no army</p>
<p>So it will be time to look into creating an national army, universities, and art academies</p>
<p>To try and overpower Prussia without going to war</p>
<p>Because remember, our economies are tied together and any war would itself be disasterous</p>
<p>Who needs opium when you have motor industries</p>

<p>Lovely, simply lovely.</p>
<p>Motor industries are not just cars but they are currently set to produce trains for me</p>
<p>Or more specifically steam engines.</p>
<p>I would agree post season 3 gets really good</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, currently eyeing up the OPMs south of me to see if trying to get access to their coal and lead is worthwhile, since their turmoil has made their small economies incapable of starting thos industries</p>
<p>But also this achieves the customs union land connection between Prussia, which means that I alone can cut their market in two if I threaten.</p>
<p>sol is the same since start</p>
<p>few bumps and lows but averaging at about 12</p>
<p>Hannover (which still exists) is going to see a delegation from Lubeck in a few months.</p>
<p>1862</p>
<p>Coal is the current main limiter of our economy.
Not as much as before Prussian issues but still rough</p>
<p>Prussia has been fighting a Stettin revolution for so long its also not helping</p>
<p>But then again... I want them to do well, but not that well</p>
<p>No colonialism for Lubeck.</p>
<p>Not while the German City states are ununited</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@enricoix</strong></p>
<p>to do what ? more conquest ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You say conquest, I say... unification</p>
<p>All Lubeckians are Germans, but all Germans do not know the joy of being a Lubeckian</p>
<p>Its our goal to change that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Orz</strong></p>
<p>If Prussia's government changes by revolution, do they keep their obligations like customs unions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, different government - different rules. 
Which is why I am not disposed to help Prussia, but I do not want them to loose.</p>
<p>Danes are not German.</p>
<p>Danes are "kinda north german"</p>
<p>different category</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@enricoix</strong></p>
<p>how many generals do you have right now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hah... Army... none</p>
<p>With the taking of Hannoverian led and coal mines</p>
<p>I will start a domestic arms industry</p>
<p>I've got wood, iron (coal and lead being worked on). (edited)</p>
<p>Sulfer is going to be harder to acquire</p>
<p>That I will have to trade for</p>
<p>Lead is a good</p>
<p>no worries</p>
<p>So, I actually back tracked on secret police</p>
<p>Because recent events and a lot of the government buildings and that has led to the rise of the intelligentsia as a considerable power</p>
<p>Or at least non-marginalized.</p>
<p>And they want to join government (which will allow for reforms that will decrease landowner and clerical power) 
But they would not join while I had that law under enactment</p>
<p>So going to risk it and start trying to secularize my schooling</p>
<p>Or restart the bureaucrat effort</p>
<p>Bunch of South Germans are migrating to South America</p>
<p>100 years early</p>
<p>(insert historical joke here)</p>
<p>Alright, that's about 2 hours and I think its time to call our Lubeck continuation
Not too many scary and or drastic things - just the world trying to knit itself back together</p>

<p>You all have a lovely weekend.</p>
<p>Its only when looking at the starting screenshot</p>
<p>That I realize "not too eventful" was a 100%+ increase in GDP</p>
<p>Radicalization doesn't worry me. 
We took over two failing states to rehabilitate them, it will take some time.</p>
<p>Plus we continue to get turmoil based migration from Prussia</p>

<h4>AAR : Greece - Greece by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>1836 - Greece is in a rough state, its economy is tiny, its military large, its bureaucracy unable to cope.</p>
<p>We owe obligations to France, UK, and Russia.</p>
<p>We have a truce with the Ottomans.</p>
<p>Our goal - to recover Greek Homelands and surpass the Sick Man of Europe.</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Greece%20-%20Greece/a8f1993d4a747591-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Greece%20-%20Greece/a8f1993d4a747591-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>Obligations are Favors.</p>
<p>I am a Kingdom, but a minor power in the world.</p>
<p>One of the first things I need to do is rebalance.</p>
<p>The truce with the Ottomans means prime time to build a domestic industry - put in place laws and get reforms moving.</p>
<p>I'm going to make money fueling an empire's war economy - and then start my own army.</p>
<p>I'm debating 2 ideas for markets.
Either British or Ottoman</p>
<p>Stay with me, if I join the Ottoman market, I can try and pull my own greek pops back to Greece.</p>
<p>That's what I am thinking.</p>
<p>I've got a year, not enough time to put up defenses, but enough time for some diplomacy</p>
<p>I'm thinking Russia and England are people to sway.</p>
<p>In fact GBR would already offer a protectorate.</p>
<p>Before we find a GP to protect us, we need to focus on our economy a bit - as its weakness is hurting our relations.</p>
<p>But a delegation has been sent to both London and St. Petersburg</p>
<p>Going to try and avoid consumption taxes atm so I can use the authority to push through some reforms faster</p>
<p>I'm going to need to make Greece a bit of a decent sol to pull in migrants once I need that</p>
<p>Protectorate is a subject relationship that still has fairly high autonomy for me as Greece.</p>
<p>GB can start a diplo play to reduce my autonomy in the future, but I am hoping it will not come to that.</p>
<p>Not able to join the British Market Customs Union atm, but by swearing as a protectorate its much more likely.</p>
<p>Doing Hospitals atm because I intend to go heavy into Iron and mining mortality is a thing I wish to avoid</p>
<p>Protectorate does not grant you a "I'm under X nation" flag</p>
<p>I've got Wood, Iron, Lead, Sulfur, various agricultural products.</p>
<p>A little bit of everything but nothing in abundence.</p>
<p>Might have to focus hard on production tech to compensate</p>
<p>I pay nothing, except I've given GB the chance to start a play to erode my authority and make me a puppet.</p>
<p>I gain the security that regardless of whether GB has an interest in th e med, they are able to come to my defense.</p>
<p>Correct</p>
<p>Its given them a bit of a bump to relations, so I'm hoping to use that to convince them.</p>
<p>AI strategies and objectives mostly.</p>
<p>Ideological differences was originally standing in the way of us cemeting a customs union.</p>
<p>Now I need to make sure I have convoys and ports setup before I say yes</p>
<p>Otherwise that will be bad.</p>
<p>No but I'm not exactly running on a good balance atm</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DarkLordDae</strong></p>
<p>So there's no hard limit like GB has no option to accept because relation with Greece is not high enough, right? in MP GB can accept any nation into their market regardless of the relationship if that is the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relations plays into it, but its not the sole factor.</p>
<p>I'd show you the breakdown tooltip but its WIP</p>
<p>GB... like any great power is not really willing to let go once its set in its claws</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: Demand Independence End Customs Union</font></p>
<p>Its a diplomatic action, I can ask and not its a play</p>
<p>Or I can just start a play</p>
<p>For me, priority of a sales market</p>
<p>I need to be able to sell off goods if I want to build an industry to fund a military capable of defending myself</p>
<p>How sales works in Customs Unions is something for a future Dev Diary.</p>
<p>But I would not treat it as a Vicky2 priority system - its a bit different.</p>
<p>I am in the British Market, when I mean priority of sales I mean my natural demand is higher because I am selling to more pop orders.</p>
<p>A better explanation of Customs unions and how it works is coming in a future dev diary, I am not going to go into detail about it now.</p>
<p>I'm not spoiling what a future dev diary will entail.</p>

<p>I've not been annexed, Greece is still blue - not the color of GBR.</p>

<p>CS? be more specific please</p>
<p>You are all too focused on grabbing territory. Right now we need to ensure we have the economy and then military to hold it.</p>
<p>Yes but I got lucky that the Ottomans are actually not considering me someone to mess with, and I am tacking advantage of that</p>
<p>(one moment please - attempting to undo a bug)</p>
<p>Protectorate does not neccessitate me being in the British Market, so I could join another customs union.</p>
<p>I've had to reload the save a year or two back, before joining the customs union because I got stuck in a bug.</p>
<p>I'm not going into any more detail on CUs at this moment.</p>
<p>I've already said there will be a future dev diary</p>
<p>Horribly</p>
<p>I'm back under GBR Union and my market access is hard to maintain.</p>
<p>No its back to 1837, its very much a focus on building up internally</p>
<p>Smuggling is not a mechanic in the game.</p>
<p>Looming debt crisis</p>
<p>Just Greek Things</p>
<p>I'm playing Greece, please take the Byzantium hype elsewhere please.</p>

<p>I've got to get an economy going first.
Its not easy.</p>

<p>That and a few more things</p>
<p>Wish the GB would help me secure my supply lines but I guess they are busy</p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p>Hopefully not, I have domestic resources, just not the industry to utilize them.</p>

<p>I'm more focused in trying to address my own shortages I need timber and fabric.</p>
<p>I do not have the ability to grow opium</p>
<p>Right now I've gone heavy orthodoxy with the devout - I want to have the benefits of such.</p>
<p>Eventually I will swtich to empower the Armed Forces</p>
<p>Yep</p>
<p>bit of pop growth</p>
<p>I regret tying myself into the British market right now</p>
<p>This was likely a far too early endeavor for my little economy.</p>
<p>The demand of the market as a whole</p>
<p>My pops are getting drowned out by the law of large numbers.</p>
<p>Prices are going up a bit faster than wages in Greece atm.</p>
<p>So I've had a spout of turmoil due to that.</p>
<p>Good news, I'm building more industries to sell, bad news - I was not equipped to handle this rush when it started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@DarkLordDae</strong></p>
<p>Oh... you're in... but not what you expected huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm in... and uh I tried to get out.
And then GB went 'about that obligation'</p>
<p>Two years or so, but debating whether I should then</p>
<p>That old save still has the obligation</p>
<p>I start with it.</p>
<p>I'm just doing my best to prevent a mass wave of migration right now</p>
<p>ngl, not going how I planned.
Is fun trying to "avoid the meltdown"</p>
<p>Did some decrees to increase wealth and sol in specific states, trying to target expensive goods to make sure my pops are not struggling.</p>
<p>And trying to build an export of cotton and lumber industry so my pops can also just pay the higher prices</p>
<p>How about I try to not reduce taxes and go further in the red? (edited)</p>
<p>Cotton is currently viable.
Also you need to remember that the plantation economy of the south may have the cotton gin but they don't supply the world alone.</p>
<p>But yes, I have to compete with other Britishmarkets like India.</p>
<p>oof, I just got hit by a migration wave</p>
<p>out of the country</p>
<p>Lost about 5-10% of my population</p>
<p>Well I'm leaving the Customs Union as soon as I can</p>
<p>More people are leaving Greece than joining it</p>
<p>Now is not the time to get ahead of ourselves</p>
<p>now is the time to fix he leaky ship</p>
<p>I think you misunderstand what I have been trying to do.</p>
<p>Less people means increasing wages, but I cannot sell my goods profitably on the market - you need to remember I am competing with other nations in the union.</p>
<p>And that's where the pops are going</p>
<p>Time for the great econ realignment of leaving the union.</p>
<p>This proves the point, a customs union is not always a good thing. There are so many variables to consider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dewit</strong></p>
<p>ok, why cant you sell your goods profitably? due to market access or inefficient production method or something else?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are only 5% of the production of X good and 95% is being driven by labor and production costs elsewhere in the market and your wages start stagflating because of losing a qualified laborforce.</p>
<p>Your increased wages are not going to have enough draw to increase prices of the goods, you just go out of business.</p>
<p>Numbers are for example. (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@DarkLordDae</strong></p>
<p>Like in real world counterparts, it's designed for the more industrious and stronger economies to benefit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not always, you can succeeded as an unindustrialized part of the union, but I could not with the supply and sol factors of home.</p>
<p>Already did</p>
<p>the quiet was me frantically rebalancing the eco</p>
<p>Plan B is to sit back and chill for a few</p>
<p>I don't have many more pops I can move around in my industries atm.</p>
<p>I will stay domestic and move through some tools and efficiency increases.</p>
<p>If I can keep SOL above 10 continously I will reconsider joining the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>
<p>This makes me wonder if the Ottoman CU might have been the stronger play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm of the opinion that it would have just been full of different problems to deal with.</p>
<p>No, no AAR here - just a barely solvent Greece attempting to stay afloat in 1843</p>
<p>Pay no attention to the poor dev behind the curtain.</p>
<p>During that whole economic debacle I tried passing a professional military law and it stalled out bigtime... oof</p>
<p>And... uh I need a workforce so propertied women it is!</p>
<p>This is bound to go over well with the church and landowners.</p>
<p>Greece knows neither military or navy, we are focusing on building a domestic arms industry first</p>
<p>And apparently I don't even have the tech for that</p>
<p>... big oof</p>
<p>I started like that, and I disbanded them since the Ottomans signled they were conciliatory</p>
<p>Military Research! (I rarely use thee, time to go take a look) (edited)</p>
<p>My economy is doing better than before the CU with GBR and my population is recovering post migration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@DarkLordDae</strong></p>
<p>can you request tech share from overlord?</p>

<p>Tech spread is innate from that, requesting exact techs, no.</p>
<p>But for RP purposes, I'm still a bit salty at Great Britain right now</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dewit</strong></p>
<p>but its not like they forced it on him</p>

<p>OH BUT THEY DID IN THE END</p>
<p>I tried to leave and they went NOPE</p>

<h4>AAR : Martin's Ottoman Official AAR - Martin's Ottoman Official AAR by Martin "Wiz" Anward</h4>
<p>I will start the AAR here in little more than 30 minutes. As I play, I'll be taking screenshots quite a bit and trying to answer some questions from the AAR chat channel (the answers will be written here). Since this is the first 'official' AAR, I'd just like to remind people that I will be playing on hot code, so while the aim is to play for about 8 hours (with a break or two), there's a chance my game might become unstable or otherwise break. If this happens, I'll try to pick it up or restart it at a later time.</p>
<p>I will be playing as the Ottomans, with the goal of building up a rural-based economy, maintaining conservative values and a traditional power structure while also trying to reform and strengthen the empire and retake lost lands.</p>
<p>It's OK to ping me in
v3-aar-general-chat to ask questions, just be aware that I will not answer every question. How many I answer will depend on how many there are and how much time it takes away from playing - it might be just a few, it might be a lot. With that in mind, please don't spam the same question.</p>
<p>Alright, it's time to start!</p>
<p>This is me, the Ottoman Empire of 1836, also known as the Sick Man of Europe. Now, you might be wondering how I got into this situation.</p>

<p>It is true that the Empire is weak, and in need of some reform. But the reason for that has nothing to do with our traditional ways of ruling, and everything to do with weak rulers who have allowed Western influences to creep into and weaken our realm. We will reform, and cast off the title of Sick Man, but we will do so in our own way, without losing who we are. We will crush the separatist movements, strengthen the army and retake Syria from the rebellious Governor of Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt was able to defeat us largely due to the poor state of the Ottoman army. Instead of maintaining a professional and well-equipped force, we rely heavily on a semi-feudal system of irregulars, which means that while on paper our army is quite large (and relatively cheap to maintain) it hasn't stood up well to Egypt's western-style forces. Our artillery is also outdated, and we depend on foreign imports to supply it.</p>

<p>Our first reform goal will be to Modernize the Army. There's a lot of areas we don't want to emulate the West in, but the army is one of them, as it's clear that we have no chance of reclaiming Syria, Egypt and our other lost territories otherwise. To do this, there's a few things we're going to need to do:
- Switch our Barracks from Irregulars to Line Infantry. This will require us to acquire a large supply of Small Arms.
- Research Napoleonic Warfare, and switch our artillery to Mobile Artillery. This means we need to fix our supply issues of Artillery.
- Build up a proper army reserve. To do this, we will need to reform our archaic levy system and either acquire more people to conscript, or increase our conscription rate by abolishing Jizya.</p>

<p>We invite them into the government. This opens up an opportunity to reform our army model. This is actually quite a popular idea, many of the IGs approve of it either inherently or because of their leader's ideology.

We're certainly not going to take their Allah-given right to rule away however, so we'll just have to try and convince them.</p>

<h4>AAR : Emu War Journal Modding - Emu War Journal Modding by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>Today we're gonna make a journal entry</p>
<p>A Journal Entry about the most significant historical conflict of the period our game covers</p>
<p>That of course being the Emu War</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mppqlmd</strong></p>
<p>emu wars ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow you actually called it</p>
<p>So first up we need to make a new journal entry in the journal entries folder</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/8f526e1b2616f948-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/8f526e1b2616f948-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: je__ emu war { H</font></p>
<p>Easy enough</p>
<p>But we've got some design decisions to make</p>
<p>We need to decide under what circumstances this should be shown in the Journal and when it ought to activate</p>
<p>According to my academic source, wikipedia.org, the conflict was confined to Western Australia, which is also a State Region in Victoria 3</p>
<p>However, emus seem to have a natural range that extends far beyond that single state</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/cf5f892e1bf7d425-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/cf5f892e1bf7d425-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: DROMAIUS NOVAEHOLLANDIAE Emu's recorded observations map (Dromaius Novaehollandiae). Areas where emu has been recorded.</font></p>
<p>So there's three ways we could go here in terms of the scope of the content:
1. Historical. It happened in Western Autralia so it'll be there in V3. This is not really consistent with our design philosophy.
2. Dynamic. We could pick a random Australian state that meets a set of appropriate conditions.
3. Universal. We represent a broader emu-human conflict across all applicable Australian states.
I'm torn between 2 and 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Stretchy</strong></p>
<p>Maybe any state will developed farms gets emu attention since if I remember right the problem was caused by them going away from their normal migration paths to eat farms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this. Sounds like a compromise between options 2 and 3</p>
<p>Oh and we should also decide who can get this content. Two approaches here:
1. Restrict to countries with Australian primary culture
2. Available to anyone who owns an applicable state</p>
<p>I think option 2 is fine, but not without its downsides. Those being that this fairly small and honestly quite silly content wouldn't be super appropriate if the player is e.g. a massive expansionist Japanese empire.</p>
<p>But the people have spoken</p>
<p>So now we've got the conditions under which this should appear in the journal</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/20f9e8021e6fbff2-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/20f9e8021e6fbff2-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>In fact, this is better. Here we've separated the conditions for having the content appear in the journal vs the conditions for activation. So you'll see this as an inactive journal entry if you own an Australian state, and you'll be told that it will activate once you've extensively developed agriculture in one of them</p>

<p><strong>@Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes that's why it's so low. I considered even making it 0. Northern Australia has so little arable land that it wouldn't be at all hard to do</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You know what, we can account for that. I've added triggers for the total amount of arable land needed in the state for this to be relevant</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Archemide | I don't know history</strong></p>
<p>Maybe a percentage of arable land has been developed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think narratively we're going with the idea that you've developed your agriculture so much that you're encroaching upon core emu territory, so I'm happy with the triggers we have</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mppqlmd</strong></p>
<p>the minimum of 15 arable land is to avoid it to fire on a tiny little treaty port ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That wasn't what I was thinking, but it actually does account for that situation as well!</p>
<p>We're also going to scope this content in terms of time. I think timeout = 1825 is appropriate here. I'm thinking that you'll have 5 years to either resolve the problem or fail to do so.</p>
<p>I've fleshed out the overall design a little more and more or less completed the journal entry script itself. So upon activation an event will fire, as well as on completion and on the timeout</p>

<p>Yeah that's all there as well above. Didn't show it because it's not interesting to us right now</p>
<p>Destroying the farms wouldn't be a good option imo. The player shouldn't be encouraged to un-develop their country</p>
<p>I've made a start just going by what felt obvious. So we've selected a random state to be the "epicenter" of the Emu War, and which we'll be using in the event text. I've also gone ahead and save the Rural Folk since I'm pretty sure they'll be relevant here as well. In the event option (maybe we'll have multiple), all owned states that meet the conditions will get a negative agricultural throughput modifier.</p>

<p>Alright I think I've decided that rather than deciding how you approach a solution to the emus in the event option, the JE should tell you about what you can do and leave you to it. So we need to come up with pro-active player actions that make sense in this context (edited)</p>
<p>Throughout 1930 and onward, exclusion barrier fencing became a popular means of keeping emus out of agricultural areas (in addition to other vermin, such as dingoes and rabbits).[23][12] - according to our good friend Wikipedia, fences were an effective means of combating the emu threat. There are a couple of fencing PM's that farms can use, so that would make sense as a trigger.</p>
<p>We should also have a more militaristic option</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Viligans</strong></p>
<p>If motorization is a PM for barracks, maybe have at least 1 local state barracks have Motorization &amp; machine guns as PMs selected? Represent having access to the jeeps and machine guns to "fight the war", so to speak?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quite like this</p>
<p>And doing it in the local state means you can't just rely on a huge military complex in your capital</p>
<p>Alright I think we have our completion conditions!</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/6fa119fe372bbb82-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/6fa119fe372bbb82-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>So, all of your states that have been afflicted with the emu modifier need to EITHER have livestock ranches with advanced fences, or barracks with mechanized infantry</p>
<p>There's a bit of an issue with this trigger though: it can be completed instantly</p>
<p>The player can just turn on these PM's and the whole thing will be over in an instant</p>
<p>Even if their economy can't really support it</p>
<p>There's a solution to that</p>

<p>Exactly. I'm thinking 3 years</p>
<p>So we've got some slightly more complicated scripting to do now</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Archemide | I don't know history</strong></p>
<p>That would mean you only have 2 years to get them running?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Emu War is an imminent crisis that must be addressed as a matter of urgency!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>
<p>Do the buildings just need to exist or is there a way to make sure they are actually operating at a high capacity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can check for things like profitability and employment, but I don't think that's really what this content is about</p>
<p>The Journal Entry is now a lot more technically complicated. I'll run through it in parts</p>
<p>This section deals with what happens when the JE activates. First off we're setting a variable called emu_war_war, and tracking that variable is how we're going to determine the player's success.</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/6e1cba95d2503445-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/6e1cba95d2503445-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: immediate { set_variable name emu war var value trigger_event { id emu war.1</font></p>
<p>And we've added this whole new section. This creates a monthly pulse that enacts an effect if the triggers return true. So if the player is meeting the completion requirements at the time of the monthly pulse, the variable is advanced by 1.</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/969f79cf88276dcb-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/969f79cf88276dcb-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: on_monthly_pulse { effect { if = limit every_scope_state limit has_modifier emu war_modifier OR any_scope_building { is_building_type building_livestock_ranch has_active_production_method pm_electric_fencing level 7= 10 any_scope_building is_building_type building_barracks has_ active_production_method pm_mechanized_infantry level &gt;= 5 change_variable { name emu_ war_ var add</font></p>
<p>This script tells the journal entry that we're interested in tracking the emu_war_var variable as a completion condition, and then tells it that we want this variable to be advanced by 36 (so 3 years worth of monthly successes). Finally since we have the functionality to do so, I've added a progress bar that will show your progress towards advancingthe variable to completion</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/eba69d2c88996de4-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/eba69d2c88996de4-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: current_value { root.var emu_war_var goal_add_value add 36 progressbar yes</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Archemide | I don't know history</strong></p>
<p>Do we maybe want 2 separate variables to track progress for each? If I do 1 year of machine guns while I get tech to do 2 years of electric fences, I get the fence 'ending'?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we can keep things simple in the script here. But what we totally can do is look at the ending conditions and apply effects based on what the player did. A mix of both approaches could have additional rewards or consequences</p>
<p>Oh and we'll throw this in before QA yells at me about what happens if you lose all your emu wars states</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/dc9237ffbdc6e2c8-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding%20-%20Emu%20War%20Journal%20Modding/dc9237ffbdc6e2c8-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>@Archemide | I don't know history</strong></p>
<p>Is there a way to check historically though? You wouldn't want the player to swap everything to the ending they want for just the last month, when they were doing one for the other 2.9 years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, we could do it that way. But after a certain point you don't get much additional value out of extra complexity and imo that would cross the line in terms of cost vs benefit. As with all things in game development, time and maintainability are important things to consider</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>
<p>Could this Journal trigger simultaneously for multiple nations controlling different parts of Australia?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see why not!</p>
<p>Oh and I recall someone mentioning earlier about what happens if the player doesn't have the tech for the solutions. Since this is very much intended to be later game content, we can simply gate it all behind actually having these techs</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>

<p>Let me know if you want any help</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Arctem | Horse Mod</strong></p>
<p>I mean, is it that bad if it triggers early enough that they can't feasibly solve it (or have to go hard on the right techs)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think generally if we're presenting players with content it's a lot less fun if they don't have ways to meaningfully interact with it. There are some cases where this is acceptable, but this is the emu wars - fun is the goal</p>
<p>I'm now going to take the time actually actually create the is_in_australia trigger since that's kind of critical to this actually working</p>
<p>There we go. Now other CD's, as well as modders, have a convenient way to check if a state is in Australia</p>

A fellow CD would then review my request and give me feedback on any bugs they find or ways to qualitatively improve things. If it gets approved, I'd document my work in jira, it would be merged into the development build ofthe game, and some poor QA would have to test it</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That would be a good option for the failure event - pay a bunch of money to reduce the impact of the modifier</p>
<p>So yeah hopefully this has given folks some insight into how content designers work on Victoria 3, and how modders will be able to make their own content once we release</p>

<p>This means that the more we build, the more we dig into our already limited capacity to distribute goods around the market</p>
<p>And the economy, or for that matter our society, is not going places unless we can start building</p>

<p>We're quite a long way from trains. And.... we are not good at research. Being Unrecognized as well as having very harsh laws forbidding dissent are really hurting our research rate. Plus we have Universities.</p>

<p>Yeah I think Decrees are going to be really important early on</p>
<p>I'm thinking that in order to rush trains, we should not simply research the prerequisite techs. We're going to start with Academia - build some Universities to boost our research rate and only THEN do we go trains</p>

<p>Because we're consuming it through our military buildings</p>
<p>First up I'm going to expand my construction sector</p>
<p>We should also work out where we want to go legally</p>
<p>It seems like moving from our economic system from Traditionalism to Agrarianism would be both popular and profitable. Agrarianism would allow us to subsidize a lot more industries if we need to, and it allows Aristocrats to contribute to the Investment Pool</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's all domestic!</p>
<p>And with that I'm going to unpause</p>
<p>So we want to churn out a lot of wood. There's two ways we can go about that:
1. Build a whole lot of Logging Camps. This will employ more people (and we have A LOT of peasants living on Subsistence Farms).
2. Use more advanced Production Methods, building Tooling Workshops to support that. The downside here is that Tools take Wood as an input good.
I can't say for sure if I'm right and I'm not going to do a lot of digging to determine this, but I think that option 1 might be best for my economy right now</p>
<p>Of course we're still going to need Tools because we also want to expand our Iron Mines (edited)</p>
<p>Now that I have a larger construction industry, the price of wood has skyrocketed. Better get chopping that wood!</p>

<p>This was pretty much all our current government is good for. I think it's time for a change</p>

<p>Just a few more Camps and we'll switch over to Iron</p>
<p>We just got a Journal Entry! If we can keep the Shogunate's IG out of power for 10 years we can really start making some progress</p>
<p>Oh and by out of power I mean not just out of government. We need to greatly reduce their political clout</p>
<p>Best way to do that is to change the makeup of our economy and society so that they cease to be a relevant force</p>
<p>But.. a little bit of coercion would help too</p>

<p>We might have overdone the iron mine expansion. Iron is now dirt cheap, meaning the people who are mining it aren't being paid very well</p>
<p>Another way to think of it: let's use more iron!</p>
<p>I guess you can make artillery out of iron. And the army is complaining that cannons are expensive</p>

<p>What else would I do with all this iron?</p>
<p>Good news, we have Academia! Time to queue up some Universties</p>
<p>Universities will fix our research speed issue, allowing us to get to trains faster. Employing Academics will also increase the power of the Intelligentsia, who will be vital to reforming Japanese society</p>
<p>Building more Arms Industries made Artillery cheaper, which lessens the burden on government expenses</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>are the mines profitable enough?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just barely</p>
<p>We still have a very large budget surplus.</p>
<p>I'm going to use part of it to increase Government Wages to maximum</p>
<p>This will increase the wealth of Academics and Bureaucrats and anyone else who works directly under the purview of government funded, except for the military. It'll also make the Intelligentsia happy</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>
<p>this will weaken the shogunate then</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>With all these Academics running around, we're burning through a lot of paper</p>
<p>Should build some Paper Mills</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skellius9(An-Staf-Wor-ism)</strong></p>

<p>Plenty!</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It does indeed. It's a direct government expense</p>
<p>We're researching Railways!</p>
<p>This would be a good time to start making some preparatory industries.</p>
<p>To make the trains run on time, we're going to need 3 things we currently don't have at all: Coal, Steel, and Engines</p>
<p>Coal can be found in the ground under Kyushu</p>
<p>Steel is made out of Iron primarily, and thankfully we have a lot of iron</p>
<p>And Engines need Steel</p>

<p>To be fair I'm a nigh-omniscient being who knows what a train is</p>
<p>For now these new coal mines and steel mills will be VERY unprofitable. We can't use them for anything really</p>

<h4>AAR : Japan - Pt.2 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>Hello! I'll be returning to the Japan AAR in just a bit</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel "neondt" Tolman</strong></p>
<p>Red Japan is back!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when we left off, we kicked off the Restoration - The Komei Restoration, given that Meiji is not yet reigning - and returned Japan to a glorious red (edited)</p>
<p>We've got 3 journal entries to complete in order to resolve the restoration:
- We need to retire the samurai and modernize the military. This one we'll complete very shortly, since we've been keeping up with our military tech and PM usage anyway.
- We need to urbanize. A lot more of our states need larger urban centers - another condition is that most of our states need railways, but we have those already!
- This one is by far the most difficult. We need to end our economic isolation and become a Recognized Power</p>
<p>Outside of Journal Entries, a major goal for this campaign is to develop a capitalistic economy where the Industrialists wield a great deal of political power</p>
<p>Currently nothing because they're still MArginalized</p>
<p>Right now there is essentially no support whatsoever for reforming our trade policy</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Japan%20-%20Pt.2%20-/c35a1e89aaa8da17-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Japan%20-%20Pt.2%20-/c35a1e89aaa8da17-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>My personal goal of empowering the Industrialists is to some extent a prerequisite for completing my Journal Entries, since the Industrialists will certainly support a move away from Isolation (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Cerise à bascule [TeamToothpast]</strong></p>
<p>Who are these Squabbling 23%ers who don't like to import Hamburgers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Support for Isolation (and opposition to alternatives) comes both from the Landowners (formerly the Shogunate but the Shogun is permanently removed from power) and the Peasantry (edited)</p>
<p>I would also quite like to shift the state religion from Buddhism to Shinto. But right now we have the State Religion law, which means that doing so would make most of our population discriminated</p>
<p>So I think I'll hold off on that until we liberalise our religious laws a little</p>
<p>It's part of a slow nation-wide process, but I've transitioned more of my Logging Camps to Private Ownership by enabling Sawmills, a more advanced Production Method. This means I made more wood, consume more tools, employ more Capitalists and Machinists, and employ less Laborers and Shopkeepers</p>
<p>These logging camps are doing pretty well</p>

<p>There's always a demand for wood, you can never have enough! Especially in a closed economy where you can't just import more</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Stretchy</strong></p>
<p>oh would you say japan is proto-industrial yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps proto-industrial</p>
<p>Right now I'm building some more Silk Plantations. The price has become quite high since we started employing Capitalists - wealthier pops means more demand for luxuries</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Stretchy</strong></p>
<p>next step is getting coal and more factories?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll certainly be wanting more coal, yes!</p>
<p>Bye-bye Samurai</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: The Fall of the Samurai Event in Kanto Japan has succeeded in reforming the armed forces and putting an end to the backwards system of feudalism. The Armed Forces warrior caste seemingly no longer have a place within our modernizing society: The Shogun commanded the loyalty of the Daimyo, who in turn relied 0n their Samurai to them enforce their rule over the enserfed peasantry. This the basis of Japanese feudalism HOW relic of the past: There are those still loyal to Samurai ideals; the codes and virtues known as Bushido, and that will surely endure: But the Samurai have fallen, and we will not see their like Let them their status as officers and nobles. The era of Samurai is over. help was legacy again . keep</font></p>
<p>We're going to let the remnants of the old elite keep their officer positions though</p>
<p>Antagonizing the army just doesn't seem like a great idea. Downside is that further military innovation is going to be a lot more expensive</p>
<p>So that's 1 down, 2 to go</p>

<p><font size=1>OCR: The Komei Restoration</font></p>
<p>I'm going to do something possibly dangerous. The Monks are really powerful, and I'm not a fan of that. And as I said before, having State Religion makes switching to Shinto a bad idea currently. So I'm going to defy the Monks and try (and possibly fail) to secularize a little</p>
<p>Okay so revolution progress began almost instantly</p>
<p>This is fine</p>
<p>Maybe</p>
<p>It's only ... the landowners. the peasantry. and the monks (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Stretchy</strong></p>
<p>maybe try and remove the monks from bureaucracy first instead?</p>

<p>It works the other way around unfortunately</p>

<p>If I can pass this law, the Monks will lose A LOT of their power</p>
<p>This seems like a good time to raise military wages. Just in case</p>
<p>The army is very loyal right now at least</p>
<p>There's a lot of demand for meat, yet thinking long term I don't want to use up too much of my arable land. My solution: whaling</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>
<p>Are there limits on what regions can develop a Whaling industry similar to how there are limits on what places can grow certain crops?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a handful of states in the game are able to develop a whaling industry. Hokkaido is one of them</p>
<p>Oh but before I do that</p>
<p>I just realized we could be building a lot faster</p>
<p>I'm moving my Construction Camps to Iron-Frame Buildings. Which will consume a whole lot more Iron and Tools. I should make some more of those</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Budget took a massive hit due to the newly increase cost of these goods. Which should hopefully be rectified shortly (edited)</p>
<p>My budget doubled when I finished a large batch of Iron mines. Government consumption of goods is a really major economic factor</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Cerise à bascule [TeamToothpast]</strong></p>
<p>How do you profit off the Iron Mines?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not so much that I profit directly from Iron Mines (though I tax their dividends and the income of their employees). It's more that I directly but their iron, and if that's expensive then I pay a lot more</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>
<p>Are taxes keeping up tho?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taxes are fine for now. Not something I'm looking to change</p>
<p>Oh dear, game crashed</p>
<p>Let's see if restarting helps</p>
<p>(it probably won't but might as well try)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Alex "Alex" Hesseborn</strong></p>
<p>think there are a few new ctds that got in these last few days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any known workarounds?</p>
<p>Map updates aren't terribly "dangerous" in terms of CTD's. They'll break saves though</p>
<p>Anyway I tried restarting and the game crashes after a couple of weeks</p>
<p>That means this particular session is over. With any luck, CTD fixes will let the run continue another time</p>
<p>Fun fact: my whaling industries were flooding the Japanese market with worthless oil</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Alex "Alex" Hesseborn</strong></p>
<p>I guess you could try one of the other branches, but think they're kinda outdated now and you might encounter other issues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah going from nightly to stable is probably gonna cause more problems than it fixes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Dictator [Rogue Servitor Party]</strong></p>
<p>So these aren't as profitable as they could be currently</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I actually find a use for oil, they'll be extremely profitable. For now the oil is worthless, and I only care about meat production (edited)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Cerise à bascule [TeamToothpast]</strong></p>
<p>Can you use Whale Oil to fuel cars?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use whale oil for any purpose that regular oil is used for. So yes you can power a diesel engine with whales</p>
<p>I.. actually don't know if Japan is scripted to have a native source of oil. We might actually have to rely on whales if we don't manage to end our isolation by the time it becomes relevant</p>
<p>Ah nevermind, there's oil in Chubu</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Spencer</strong></p>
<p>Can pops buy Oil for heating even if the oil drilling tech isn’t unlocked? Seems a bit weird that whale oil would be worthless when that was the main driver of whaling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They can. Heating needs aren't a huge portion of pop expenditure though</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Stretchy</strong></p>
<p>im assuming oil whale will be nothing compared to a 1910's oil rig in texas or something</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah you just can't squeeze very much oil out of whales. Oil Rigs give you vastly, vastly more oil.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do with my day now, was hoping to play V3 for at least a few hours and I was enjoying myself</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Cerise à bascule [TeamToothpast]</strong></p>
<p>Start a new Playthrough</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would definitely crash again</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Stretchy</strong></p>
<p>also i hope new england has tons of whales  same with the pacific</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep</p>
<p>I don't think so</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Roses [Vanguardist-Staffordist]</strong></p>
<p>Daniel can you maybe answer a question of mine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure. Generally easier to just ask me a question rather than asking to ask me a question!</p>
<p>I think there's a dev diary that explains imports and exports somewhere</p>
<p>https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-38-trade-routes-tariffs.1515790/ - trade routes and tariffs dev diary. If the answer isn't in there then I can't talk about it</p>
<p>I think this discussion is pretty far from related to Victoria 3</p>

<h4>AAR : Japan - Pt.3 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>Alright let's get back to it then!</p>
<p>It's 1853. The Emperor has been restored to power and the Shogunate is no more</p>
<p>The Samurai have fallen, replaced by a modern professional army (edited)</p>
<p>And we are slowly industrializing</p>
<p>No colonization for now, but we'll certainly get around to it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Skelly Against Trains</strong></p>
<p>do we even have colonial institution even</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not</p>
<p>I think what I want to do first here is identify industries ripe for privatization</p>
<p>These Furniture Manufacturies for example. Now under new Capitalist management</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Japan%20-%20Pt.3%20-/0cb78d26d7dc9cae-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Japan%20-%20Pt.3%20-/0cb78d26d7dc9cae-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>We also ought to make some changes to the Paper industry</p>
<p>I can't privatize paper because I'd need to advance to a PM that requires Sulfur, and I'm not making any of that</p>
<p>So I'll build a few mines</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Starwalker</strong></p>
<p>Do mines mine different things based on where they are built or are there specific mines for each resource?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specific mines for each resource</p>
<p>Oh and people want more tea</p>
<p>What are we, Brits?</p>
<p>We're killing so many whales that meat is finally affordable</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Japan%20-%20Pt.3%20-/66345e0b8c4ad08d-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Japan%20-%20Pt.3%20-/66345e0b8c4ad08d-unknown.png" /></a></p>
<p><font size=1>OCR: 418 525 -177 {36 (+21%)</font></p>
<p>I'm privatizing the coal mines as well. They make A LOT less money as a result, for several reasons:
 - Capitalists take a higher wage than shopkeepers
- More input goods needed for atmospheric engine based mining
- More Machinists and Engineers vs Laborers, who also take a higher wage</p>
<p>And and of course:
- High coal output reduces the price of coal</p>
<p>On the other hand:
 - More capitalists = more Industrialist power
 - Cheaper coal = other industries benefit
 - The pops employed are richer</p>
<p>What I'm saying here is that pure profitability isn't the most important thing to optimize when you're micromanaging your economy</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HYPOstasis</strong></p>
<p>Does changing the PM also reduces the amount of workers in total? Or does it just increase their throughput in this case?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it does. In this particular case it actually increased the number of workers, meaning an overall increase to SoL in the state</p>
<p>Looking at more advanced base mining PM's, once you switch away from Picks and Shovels, the number of workers remains consistent. But there are other PM categories that will affect workforce differently. For instance using Steam Donkets would drastically reduce the required workforce</p>
<p>Right now I generally want to increase the amount of people employed in buildings</p>
<p>Anyway I will now stop talking about how to optimize your coal mines for the purposes of developing a capitalist economy</p>
<p>Oh. Just like how the paper industry could be privatizing by adding sulfur, the glass industry could be privatized by adding lead. I'll build some lead mines as well</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@HYPOstasis</strong></p>
<p>Do you require certain PMs in order to change ownership or is just that you're doing both at the same time? I don't remember reading anything about that but it makes sense that certain PMs require different types of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to advance beyond the most basic production PM to use anything other than Merchant Guilds for most buildings</p>
<p>Well this could have gone better</p>

<p>For reasons I'm not going to fully investigate, my national budget just increased significantly. I suppose I am making a whole lot of government goods very cheap, and I suppose all these fancy new PM's are creating a lot of taxable businesses and citizens</p>
<p>The problem with expanding dye plantations is that they employ some very wealthy clergymen, who are already uncomfortably powerful</p>
<p>I'm very very slowly researching Mutual Funds so that I can unlock PM's that employ EVEN MORE capitalists. Then I'll kick the Clergy out of the agricultural industry (not including subsistence famrs)</p>

<p>Abolish the monarchy. We're not doing this</p>
<p>Move away from Autocracy. I don't want to institute democracy, but we could at least become an Oligarchy, which would empower Capitalists as well as Aristocrats rather than only the former</p>
<p>And finally, I can just continue modernizing the economy. I'll do this anyway but it's the slowest means towards political change</p>
<p>I think I'll start by enacting Oligarchy. The Emperor must be advised by a cabal of capitalistic oligarchs who know what's best for everyone</p>

<h4>AAR : Japan - Pt.5 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>Let's play some more Japan</p>
<p>I played through a couple of years just now and managed to pass Protectionism - this is a major change to the country because it replaces Isolationism. We are now at least somewhat open to the wider world's economy, allowing trade routes.</p>
<p>The Industrialists were hugely in favour of the law</p>
<p>As it stands, there's really nothing in particular that Japan wants to buy from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>But there are some goods we're overproducing, and where I'd welcome some exports</p>
<p>In particular, we make a lot of warships, guns, artillery, explosives, and ammunition</p>

<p>No. Generally unless if the localization would just be the name translated we're not changing them. If there's a specific group that would represent the same niche as that IG we tend to localize them. I've been considering making some localizations for stuff like that around Brazil during my PDT but not sure if it will make it in</p>

<p>I'm going to say this once so I can get it out of the way: because already discriminated pops are more likely to be poor, there are a disproportionate number of Aboriginal slaves in my country. (shockingly, social discrimination begets economic disadvantages, who knew). But I am not going to gleefully take pleasure in that. There's a line to be drawn here and that definitely crosses it.</p>

<h4>AAR : Sweden - Pt.1 - by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>Grattis på nationaldagen</p>
<p>That is about the extent of my Swedish after 3 years, but in celebration I am going to run up a little AAR of Sweden in about ~15-20 mins.
Just trying to find out which branch of development is the most stable.</p>
<p>You've been warned</p>
<p>Correct</p>
<p>Swedes and Danes have traditionally passed Norway between each other a few times.</p>
<p>Don't ask me why exactly, not my knowledgeable area of history</p>
<p>Mom says its my turn for the oil reserves.</p>
<p>Pretty sure we've not simulated Norwegian Oil reserves since IIRC they are all coastal and not land based.</p>
<p>I'll be honest I would have to look into the history of when we started doing oil rigs, but that sounds like a rabbit hole I won't come out of today</p>
<p>another time</p>
<p>Yeah a little outside of the game's timeline</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Memer Nener</strong></p>
<p>tho there should be whaling right, so at least there is some oil to be had!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whaling exists, but that's honestly a different type of oil.</p>
<p>In the game yes.</p>
<p>But I am pendantic</p>
<p>In the game we utilize oil to mean the various byproducts that powered the machine age.</p>
<p>Alright its June 6th - 1836, no I did not plan to pause it then.
Its not Nationalsdag in game because the holiday did not exist then.</p>
<p>We already face a tight crisis of our industry - our government's plans to industrialize is met with the fact that we are not properly utilizing much of our needed raw resources.</p>
<p>Finland is under Russia and Russia sees us a Cordial.</p>
<p>I'm also keeping up relations with Prussia.</p>
<p>But depending on things go - I might go... strangely scandinavian.</p>

<p><strong>Memer Nener</strong></p>
<p>Does Sweden start with any stately modifiers that boost throughput?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In standard "Sweden is not OP" Paradox strategy - only those for timber, steel, and farming I think</p>
<p>Let me go look at the twitter stuff Martin has posted for a second so I make sure to only talk about know things</p>
<p>I'm playing on the Trade prototype branch</p>
<p>Done, thank you for reminding me.</p>
<p>So bureaucracy is going to be big - because I am going to go heavy into lumber, iron and steel, using that to become a baltic tradehouse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Memer Nener</strong></p>
<p>so the twitter teaser from last week?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yeah, just wanted to see what it showed so I could mention things like bureaucracy is going to be a stifling point for my nation.</p>
<p>I am going to need to balance institutions and trade benefits.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I am going to go Custom's Union at all here because I want to play and better understanding the balance of trade mechanics.</p>
<p>That is (literally) the excuse to sit down and put a few hours in today</p>
<p>Despite having to balance Bureaucracy more - I am still going for public hospitals early - if I am not going to be able to have a more religious society and get pop growth, or migration by a customs union, I want to keep mortality as low as possible.</p>

<p>Norway is already under me in a PU</p>
<p>I will remind you all, we're playing as Sweden so the Danish vs Swedish jokes will be out and about but always be respectful.
Not everyone is aware of how much Danes and Swedes truly love each other and its a sibling rivalry.</p>

<p>IE expend the economy, as the construction is mostly a temporary cost - hoping that my tax revenue will increase higher than the interest of the loan</p>

<p>you cannot easily spend authority you do not have as a capacity, though its possible to be put into a situation where you produce less for a timebeing</p>
<p>Authority's main advantage it is expedites enactment time of laws.</p>
<p>I've already started messing with the game since I was testing stability so not this time</p>
<p>You ever get that feeling that you're not building fast enough that in Sweden you find yourself IMPORTING WOOD?</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed</p>
<p>Cattle ranches yes</p>
<p>I will likely specialize the north in steel and then motors and trains</p>
<p>Just right now there's so little fabric in sweden that multiple industries are rubber banding</p>
<p>and no one is really wanting to trade that good right now (feels like machine parts with V2)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>don't ask numbers questions like that it makes my head spin and all numbers are subject to change before release.</p>
<p>It also doesn't account that multiple separate diplo pays will have different infamy costs because of the amount of costs one needs to pay to bribe in other powers multiple times.</p>
<p>It should be cheaper to vassalize than outright annexation.</p>
<p>Unification is a bit different, lets find out and do some quick math</p>
<p>So it would be 30+ infamy to conquer Denmark alone</p>
<p>if that answers your relative cost question</p>

<p>At this point I find it more reasonable to increase the number of bureaucrats than the per capita of their power - because I can only reform laws so quickly.</p>
<p>Wealth voting would see increasing wages give more clout that way but not in an easy 1:1</p>

<p>There are plans we'd like to do for release, we're hoping to get to them to make it where electricity isn't bottled and sent overseas.

<p>That's also "not exactly" how that works either.</p>
<p>We might not have disk pressing anymore but what causes the delays of done to release is certification based on platforms as well as various other thing such as localization, and other stuff.</p>
<p>Its a much more dynamic equation and you all keep boiling it down to static 1-2 variables.</p>

<p>Yeah that's national coal production.</p>
<p>Because there's prestige modifers based on that.</p>
<p>I mean prestige scales relatively in itself, if everyone gets more prestige as the game goes by the more prestige each individual bonus is worth is lessened.</p>
<p>Because power status is a relative definition of prestige compared to otehrs.</p>
<p>I could not easily figure out how to find building #1 in the world, but it also could be due to the time and my exhaustion.</p>

<p>I might play a little off hours to expedite our passage to that.</p>

<p>Hot take, I don't like ledgers.</p>
<p>Ledgers are a workaround to poor UI and workflow planning.
There's a difference between putting the information in a meaningful way and just putting the info in a ledger accessible from the menu.</p>
<p>They can be useful, but they are also a crutch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HYPOstasis</strong></p>
<p>Ledgers are really nice for graphs and AAR type things, but I don't think I've ever really used them for anything else useful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a place, the trick is making them work well.
I remember when it was easy to just look in the ledger in EUIV and tell if I was bluffing that I had troops or not</p>
<p>See now a ledger at the end to give summary info, that would be cool.
But I wouldn't want one that's constantly accessible, we should be challenged to make it where you can find that info better in the UI and workflow and just making a ledger for it.</p>

<h4>AAR : Sweden - Pt.2 - by Paul "PDJR_Alastorn" Depre</h4>
<p>Sweden, a summary: its 1846 - we've tech rushed pan nationalism.
We have the ability to unite Finland, Denmark, and Norway.</p>
<p>Norway is happy for this - our loyal PU, Denmark is not significant enough to stand against us, but Russia has many troops.
We need to muster a force able to defend ourselves if Russia will not accede to the unification peacefully.</p>

<p>Here's the crux of my current problem as Sweden</p>
<p>I only have around 100k peasants who are not employed in my industry</p>
<p>I am trying to get as many of them to go north to Stockholm and Norrland to work in the arms industry, but I also need troops
We are going to be working with very limited resources</p>

<p>Incorrect.</p>
<p>Guardianship gives birthrate modifiers nothing else.
Propertied gives minor workforce modifiers
The further you go progressive means more morework and a birthrate decrease.</p>

<p>There is an interesting Finland is defined as part of Scandinavia states possible but the play will not target them, and I think that's due to the Swedish pops in Finland but not 100% sure.</p>

<p>I have stared into the Noot and it Noot noot'd in return</p>
<p>Alright chat - I'm here for a reckless idea - what do we do?
 - We try the peaceful route, bring in the Norwegians and then when they are happy declare unifications and hopefully do not have to fight the Russians.
 - We release the Norwegians, we prep the troops - we unify by force if we have to. Intervening powers be damned</p>
<p>I am researching the mil tech as we try the peaceful route</p>
<p>So we want peaceful route</p>
<p>Possible, I shall see what I can do</p>
<p>I believe the chaffing of the Norwegians is due to the Personal Union</p>

<p>I am well aware of that, but I thought I would offer the option.</p>
<p>It is technically the same head of state - that does not mean the Norwegian government is in agreement with the Swedish one.</p>
<p>I'm just exploring my options,
There isn't any debt to take on for favors, the diplomats are trying to work on relations, bankrolling is an option</p>
<p>I'm starting to think I might... might be better off releasing Norway from a PU and trying to build a better 1:1 relationship to get their support.</p>
<p>Their government doesn't seem to need money, but I don't doubt the AI is a bit upset I'm likely taking a lot of migrants since we share a market.</p>

<p>Getting Norway to stop being a pain in my butt.</p>

<p>I can do either</p>
<p>Like I said, I either found a bug - or we expanded unifications out a bit.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna lie</p>
<p>I've found 2-3 bugs and I'm dying of laughter</p>
<p>Its not because Norway doesn't love me (edited)</p>
<p>Its because Denmark DOES</p>
<p>Unification Plays current require 2 potential nations to be valid unifiers.
But Finland and Norway are PUs and that means its just Sweden and Denmark.</p>
<p>And Denmark was supporting me for Unification.
Which means the mechanic can't find another target and its declaring the play invalid.</p>
<p>@Alex "Alex" Hesseborn either you or I need to bug this.</p>
<p>Because the game was finding only "1" supporter and 2 PUs but no opposition targets it would not allow the play.
A very edgecase bug</p>
<p>I could NOT release norway</p>
<p>and just throw insults at Denmark</p>
<p>FYI - what you are seeing here is clearly a few bugs obfuscating a mechanic, so I am going to step aside from it and what I am doing is not 100% intended gameplay but a soft workaround of the blocking bug.</p>
<p>So please do not draw conclusions on feasibility of X due to what I have said above.</p>
<p>No commands, but I would not consider it WAD that to unify scandinavia you have to make Denmark hate you</p>

<p>Is it worth it for less abstract infamy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SleekOtter</strong></p>
<p>Yeah that makes sense, but my main point was that maybe being able to unify shouldn't be dependent on a hard cut-off but easier with the more states you have within the unifying nation's "de jure" for lack of a better term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe one day, but for now and for release most likely thats how nation formation stands atm.</p>
<p>Sweden now owns: A West African Colony, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, A tiny Carribean Colony

<p>a tempting thought, but they are not the one's looking to leave.</p>

<p>Would conceding to secessionist demands by conceding this play increase chances for other separatists to rise up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot recall, I do not think we give any bonus to turmoil powering secession because of that but we may certainly give the secession movement speed in how rapidly it fires a play due to such. Depending on what territory we do let go, that could worsen turmoil and dissatisfaction due to economic upsets and further spiral things naturally. (edited)</p>

<p>Trains ended up getting bottlenecked because of shortages in their production which meant that a lot of infrastructure had issues across the nation.
I need more coal and dynamite across the board.</p>
<p>And to reevaluate which lines I subsidize and which I don't, but a future problem.</p>
<p>I can't trade without clippers, and I am also short on that</p>
<p>There are multiple problems that need sorting.
Got so distracted by the diplo play I missed the one economic cycle collapse that spread to all other industries.</p>
<p>Cause you know, that's how economics truly does work.</p>
<p>I enjoy flailing, its nice to be reminded that the game is getting more and more sophisticated and cannot be cheesed so easily. (edited)</p>
<p>I did not take it as an insult.</p>

<p>This is important because, like the tooltip says, when we inevitably implode we get to continue as a new country based on the location of our capital</p>
<p>And we want to be Guatemala</p>
<p>Now that I've changed my capital, I can't change it again for quite some time, so I've made my bed and must lie in it (edited)</p>
<p>Why, Guatemala, I hear you ask?</p>
<p>Guatemala has the most Arable Land of any Central American state, and even more importantly it has access to two resources that you won't find in any of the others: cotton and iron, vital building blocks for building our economy</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Guatemala%20-%20Pt.1%20-/370e478f017477e1-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Guatemala%20-%20Pt.1%20-/370e478f017477e1-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>Which isn't to say the other states don't have their own advantages. Costa Rica for instance has plenty of (untapped) coal deposits</p>
<p>But for the early game these basic resources will serve us better than coal, given that we're not in a larger market and have nobody in particular to sell it to without setting up a more elaborate trade network that we're not really in a position to establish</p>
<p>Things could certainly be looking better for us</p>

<p>What besides diplomacy and economics can i do in multiplayer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economics is the core loop. That is the game. Same in SP and MP</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@zeWuzard</strong></p>
<p>I agree and am excited for it but Watching any amount of time on a victoria 2 multiplayer game show what people in mp expect from a victoria title</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't feel that fostering a competitive multiplayer scene or catering to that style of play is important. It's entirely at odds with what the game is trying to achieve</p>
<p>For competitive MP, you can play HoI or EU4. You probably shouldn't look to CK or Vicky for it</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@zeWuzard</strong></p>
<p>Not competitive but interactive. I don't like competitive vic2 I get crushed in micro on vic2 but when I feel like I can't even point the front line in a direction or i want a strategic area in an enemy lands captured for diplomatic or economic reasons it doesn't seem like a good sustainable warfare system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Victoria 3, wars are lost and won on the economic, diplomatic, and technological level. That's where the challenge is, rather than during the course of a war itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@zeWuzard</strong></p>
<p>By leaving out the multiplayer people that loved the war system in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You still have that war system! In every single other PDS game</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Mumbling Historian</strong></p>
<p>V2's war system was the least important part of the game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I agree with that. I think it was a very important part of the game, in the sense that is was essentially mandatory to engage with it and doing so took up a great deal of player attention. I think it's more accurate to say that war was the least interesting part of V2</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@Meriador_</strong></p>
<p>and the fact that that was "all that was left" was a failure on the devs part</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this</p>
<p>Let's immediately stop talking about ongoing military conflicts</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@puer natura</strong></p>
<p>Does ongoing military conflicts include the territorial rivalries between me and the squirrel who lives in my tree? He keeps pissing on my window...</p>

<p>Especially that conflict</p>
<p>Strategy is when trains go choo choo</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@General_WCJ</strong></p>
<p>I really wonder if any devs have alt accounts here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what would be the point?</p>
<p>I have an alternative theory. This entire discord is just a confusing and incoherent fever dream, and in the morning I will wake up and Victoria 3 won't exist</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@puer natura</strong></p>
<p>Daniel, you're in a coma, this is the only way we can contact you, please wake up, your family misses you so much</p>

<p><strong>@Emperor Stafford Supporter</strong></p>

<p>Probably true</p>
<p>I'd play the Dishonored mod</p>
<p>I actually started on a Frostpunk mod ages ago. Game has changed far too much for it to be salvagable now. But in concept V3 is a really excellent game for a mod with that setting</p>

<h4>AAR : Guatemala - Pt.4 - by Daniel "neondt" Tolman</h4>
<p>I think it's time once again to continue Central America - Banana Republic</p>
<p>Here's where we left off</p>

<p>In terms of money and capacities we're doing pretty good.</p>
<p>A perpetual bottleneck however is population. Or rather, employable population.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that's about all I can do about this right now. There are plenty of ways that a country can achieve this - improving safety in the workplace, employing women, reducing mortality by not employing children, etc. But nobody in my country of any significance will support those measures</p>
<p>But it's possible for politicians who are not members of the Intelligentsia to support some moderate degree of reform in these areas. To do that, I have to bite the bullet and open my country to ideas about equality. This was going to happen soon or later due to tech spread, and it's going to mean that increasingly more dissident ideas are going to arise to challenge my rule.</p>

<p>It's been around a century since Ethiopia was last unified under the Emperors. Since then, petty fiefdoms and squabbling fiefdoms have torn the realm apart. We're going to fix that.</p>
<p>Or at least, we're going to try</p>
<p>From Shewa, the Empire will rise again</p>

<p>The diplomatic situation is that we hate our neighbors and they hate us</p>
<p>Being landlocked, we can't do a lot of trade, and we border nobody who has anything we want anyway</p>
<p>I'm immediately noticing that our capital state is almost at its taxation capacity limit, which means our first move should be to build a Government Administration.</p>
<p>Standard of living is... okay, by Ethiopian standards. Quite bad by the standards of people who enjoy eating food.</p>

<p>So as you can see things are getting a little... bordergorey</p>
<p>And there's a reason why I'm pushing this particular piece of bordergore. By completing my Rift Valley colony, I'll achieve 2 things:
1. Britain will be blocked off from further colonization into Tanganyika and beyond, allowing me to eventually claim that territory myself
2. Unlike Kenya, Rift Valley has large deposits of coal that I can use to industrialize my country</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Ethiopia%20-%20Pt.4%20-/5c4a2c24b5b86cd5-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Ethiopia%20-%20Pt.4%20-/5c4a2c24b5b86cd5-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>That said, once the colony is complete I will make my own colony in Kenya, both to improve the borders a little and because time is running out to claim that territory</p>
<p>We're also facing something of a cost of living crisis. When I shut down the entire agricultural industry of Somalia in order to have enough infrastructure for a gigantic iron mine, that seems to have had a major impact on the price of food</p>
<p><a href="images/discord-Ethiopia%20-%20Pt.4%20-/4deb9dab97163da7-unknown.png"><img alt="Image" src="thumbs/discord-Ethiopia%20-%20Pt.4%20-/4deb9dab97163da7-unknown.png" /></a></p>

<p>They need exactly 33 fish</p>
<p>Just for some variety</p>
<p>To address these problems, I'm building a large number of Millet Farms and Logging Camps in Gonder and Amhara. These are our safest states, the heartland of our country, and least likely to, for example, rise up in a secessionist rebellion and destroy my economy</p>

<p>That was ... an alternate timeline. And it was the opposite scenario, they forced me to join their market rather than joining mine</p>

<p>Yes!</p>
<p>One thing Oman brings to the table is war ships. This has made my naval upkeep quite a bit cheaper</p>

<p><strong>@One Proud Saarlandian</strong></p>
<p>Smart idea. Does pausing also pause the chance of an uprising in the region against our colony?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tension is generated when the colony grows, so if a colony isn't growing no additional tension is generated. This will hopefully allow my tension with the natives in that region to decay enough that they won't rise against me when I resume colonization</p>
<p>This has caused yet more radicalism, but I've decided to downsize some of my Government Administrations. They're expensive and we simple don't have the taxation capacity issues that we used to have, with better technology, laws, and production methods in use</p>
